### Countdown's Numbers Round With Genetic Algorithms

Use a genetic algorithm to play section of the famous game show. The goal is to construct a valid mathematical expression that is as close to the target as possible with only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are allowed. 

Click "SEED" to generate numbers to use and a target. Enter the number of generations you want the genetic algorithm to run for and click "RUN". (Higher numbers should produce closer values to the target.)

Note: This algorithm doesn't use parentheses, and the low power of the app means runs will take a while. There's a progress bar in the bottom right whose presence means the algorithm is running. (As a reference, 10,000 iterations takes roughly 2 minutes.) Click here to see a [blog](www.google.com) and the [code](www.google.com).
