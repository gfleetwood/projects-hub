# New Datetime Reference

Our global world could use some more standardization across the boardwhen it comes to date and time. Specifically:

* UTC

* ISO-8601

* 24 Hour Time

And I want to throw in the notion of the International Fixed Calendar (IFC). The work in this app is mainly figuring out how to implement the IFC with respect to automatic conversions and a
calendar heat map.
