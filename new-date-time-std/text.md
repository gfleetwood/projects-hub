"Variety is the spice of life."

You'd be hard pressed to find someone disagreeing with that general statement. But several things don't need variety. Like dates and times. This is a simple app imagining a world with a unified system:

* 24 hour time as the prevailing system
* UTC as the only time standard
* The International Fixed Calendar as the replacement for the Gregorian Calendar

I threw in the last one because it's just neat. Here's an app to look at [conversions](http://internationalfixedcalendar.com/). Finally, DST delenda est.
