<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.1</span> Appendix I: House Anasûrimbor</h2>
<p>The House of Anasûrimbor is the oldest dynasty of human nobility, spanning almost
four thousand years of history. The house originated in the city of Ûmerau, during the
rise of the civilisation of the Ancient North, centred on the Aumris River Valley. By the
8 th Century after the Breaking of the Gates the house had become one of the primary
noble houses in the Ûmeric Empire.</p>
<p><strong>House Anasûrimbor of Ûmerau</strong></p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Sanna-Neorjë (772-858), noble of Ûmerau, father of Omindalea.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Omindalea (808-825), daughter of Sanna-Neorjë. Raped by the
Nonman Jiricet, thus ending the Nonman Tutelage. She died in childbirth,
giving birth to Sanna-Jephera.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Sanna-Jephera (825-1032), the half-Nonman son of Omindalaea. He
was made Sanna-Neorjë’s heir. As half-Nonman, he and his descendants
enjoyed a longer lifespan than the human norm.</p>
<p><strong>House Anasûrimbor of Aörsi</strong></p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Nanor-Ukkerja I (1378-1556), the first Anasûrimbor High King,
founder of Kûniüri (in 1408). Upon his death he divided his empire in three,
founding Aörsi and Sheneor in addition to Kûniüri proper.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Mygella (2065-2111), High King of Aörsi, the Hero-King whose
deeds are recounted in The Sagas.</p>
<p>Anasurimbor Nimeric (2092-2135), the son and heir of Mygella, High King of Aörsi
during the First Apocalypse. He was killed at the Battle of Hamuir, just before
the fall of Aörsi.</p>
<p><strong>House Anasûrimbor of Kûniüri</strong></p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Nanor-Ukkerja I (1378-1556), the first Anasûrimbor High King,
founder of Kûniüri (in 1408). Upon his death, he divided his empire in three,
founding Aörsi and Sheneor in addition to Kûniüri proper.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Celmomas II (2089-2147), High King of Kûniüri, leader of the First
Ordeal and the leader of the forces opposed to the Consult in the opening years
of the Apocalypse. He was killed at the Battle of Eleneöt Fields. As he died, he
had a vision of Gilgaöl showing him a descendant of the house would return at
the end of the world, a prophecy he passed to his friend and ally Seswatha.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Nau-Cayûti (2119-2142), the youngest son of Anasûrimbor
Celmomas II and his wife Suriala, although some believe that he was the son of
Suriala by Seswatha. A great hero of the First Apocalypse whose reputation was
made at the Battle of Ossirish, where he killed the dragon Tanhafut the Red
and routed the Consult. His favourite concubine and the love of his life, Aulisi,
was kidnapped by the Consult and borne to Golgotterath, possibly to
demoralise Nau-Cayûti or provoke him into attacking the Ark precipitously.
Instead, he allied with Seswatha and, using intelligence gained in Ishterebinth
through the Amiolas, they mounted a two-man raid on the Ark. They did not
find Aulisi but did locate the Heron Spear, Seswatha admitting that he
deliberately tricked Nau-Cayûti to this end. After returning home, Nau-Cayûti
was poisoned by his wife Ieva. According to history, he died in 2140 and was
buried, rather than being cremated. In reality, the poison left him alive but
immobile. He was excavated by the Inchoroi Aurang and taken to Golgotterath.
He resisted two years of torture before being placed in the Carapace, a Tekne
112artifact. Shortly after this, the Initiation of the No-God took place. The causal
link between the two events remains unclear.</p>
<p><strong>House Anasûrimbor of Ishuäl</strong></p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Ganrelka II (2104-2147), the heir of Celmomas II. He was believed
killed at the Battle of Eleneöt Fields, but in reality, he survived and sought
sanctuary in Ishuäl, a hidden redoubt in the Demua Mountains. He died of
plague within months of arriving, as did all of his court save his bastard son.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor ? (c. 2137-?), the unknown bastard son of Celmomas II and his sole
heir. He survived the plague that consumed Ishuäl and welcomed the Dûnyain
to the stronghold.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Moënghus (c. 4050-4112), a Dûnyain monk who was sent out into the
world to investigate after the stronghold was discovered by Sranc in 4079.
Moënghus was exiled, eventually making the acquaintance of Cnaiür urs
Skiötha of the Scylvendi. After manipulating Cnaiür like a child, to his fury,
Moënghus escaped south and joined the Cishaurim of Kian. In 4100 he
captured and tortured a Consult skin-spy, learning of the Consult’s plan to
bring about the Second Apocalypse. Moënghus created the Thousandfold
Thought, an intellectual weapon to oppose the resurrection of the No-God. He
used a Cant of Calling to send for his son before initiating the Holy War as a
mechanism to bring him to Shimeh. When Kellhus reached Moënghus and told
the story of the Holy War, Moënghus realised his son had gone insane. Kellhus
stabbed his father and left him to die; however, it was left to Cnaiür to execute
Moënghus with a Chorae.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Kellhus (4076-4132), a Dûnyain monk. He was summoned into the
outside world by his father to assist him in his secret war against the Consult,
but his superiors ordered him to find and execute Moënghus instead. Kellhus
113joined the Holy War, ultimately subverting it to his cause by the time it
captured Shimeh in 4112. He learned of the Consult and the No-God and
made it his mission to destroy the organisation. However, his father believed he
had gone mad. Kellhus stabbed his father and defeated the last Cishaurim at
Shimeh. He was proclaimed Aspect-Emperor of the Three Seas in 4112, but
faced ten years of warfare before being able to finally secure the Three Seas. He
then turned the Three Seas into a machine to build the greatest amassing of
armed and sorcerous might ever seen: the Great Ordeal. In 4132 the Great
Ordeal marched against Golgotterath and was destroyed. It was revealed that
Kellhus had allied with the God Ajokli to conquer the hells and destroy the
Consult, but he was betrayed by his son Kelmomas and slain with a Chorae. In
the aftermath of his death, Ajokli railed because he was unable to find Kellhus’s
soul and feast upon it as he desired.</p>
<p>Maithanet (c. 4085-4132), the son of Anasûrimbor Moënghus. Trained in Dûnyain
ways by his father, he infiltrated the Thousand Temples and rose to the rank of
Shriah at a young age. On his father’s instruction, he declared the Holy War
against the Fanim. In the closing weeks of the war he forged an unprecedented
alliance between the Thousand Temples and the Mandate school before
recognising Maithanet’s half-brother Kellhus as Aspect-Emperor. Their mutual
support allowed Kellhus to win the Unification Wars. Maithanet remained a
close supporter of Kellhus, but became concerned that Kellhus was letting
emotion for his wife and children cloud his judgement. He was executed by the
White-Luck Warrior on the order of the Empress Esmenet in 4132.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Koringhus (c. 4105-4132), Anasûrimbor Kellhus’s first son, born from a
“whale-mother” in Ishuäl ere Kellhus’s departure. Known as “the Survivor”, he
survived the ruination of Ishuäl by the Consult in great secret before being
rescued by Drusas Achamian and Anasûrimbor Mimara. Driven insane by his
experiences, he killed himself by hurling himself from the mountains.</p>
<p>“The Child” (c. 4122- ), the son of the Survivor, born in Ishuäl. Cunning and
114ruthless, he survived the Sack of Ishuäl by the Consult before being rescued by
Drusas Achamian and Anasûrimbor Mimara. After being captured by the
Scylvendi under Cnaiür urs Skiötha, he fled into the night and escaped. His
current whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<p><strong>House Anasûrimbor of the New Empire</strong></p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Kellhus (4076-4132), Aspect-Emperor of the Three Seas (proclaimed
4112, crowned 4122). In 4132 the Great Ordeal marched against Golgotterath,
led by Kellhus, and was destroyed utterly.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Esmenet (4078- ), Empress of the Three Seas (proclaimed 4112,
crowned 4122), the wife of Anasûrimbor Kellhus, whom she met in 4110,
during the Holy War. The former lover of Drusas Achamian. She survived both
the downfall of Momemn and the New Empire, and the battle at Golgotterath.
Anasûrimbor Kayûtas (4112- ), eldest son of Kellhus and Esmenet, general of the
Kidruhil. Serving in the Great Ordeal. It is believed he survived the final battle
at Golgotterath.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Theliopa (4114-4132), eldest daughter of Kellhus and Esmenet, born
in the White-Sun Palace in Nenciphon after the fall of Kian, during the
Unification Wars. Slightly unhinged from her intelligence, she remained
alongside her mother as an advisor. She was killed by the machinations of the
White-Luck Warrior in Momemn.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Serwa (4115- ), daughter of Kellhus and Esmenet. Noted for her
formidable grasp of sorcery. Taught in the Metagnosis by her father, Serwa
because Grandmistress of the Swayal Compact as a teenager. Her sorcerous
skills are utterly formidable; aside from her father, she may be the most
powerful human sorcerer to have lived since Titirga himself, three thousand
115years earlier. Serving in the Great Ordeal. She was severely wounded by both
dragonfire and Chorae during the final battle at Golgotterath. Her fate is
unknown.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Inrilatas (4117-4132), son of Kellhus and Esmenet. He inherited his
father’s skills for analysis and manipulation, but he was also insane, unable to
use reasoned judgement. He attempted to kill his uncle Maithanet and was
killed in self-defence.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Samarmas (4124-4132), son of Kellhus and Esmenet. Twin of
Kelmomas. A quiet boy, described by his brother as his “idiot twin”. Samarmas
was killed by the machinations of his brother. After his death, Kelmomas could
hear his twin speaking to him in his mind.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Kelmomas (4124- ), youngest surviving son of Kellhus and Esmenet.
Noted for his utter cunning, ruthlessness and obsession with retaining the love
of his mother. Highly distrustful of his father and his siblings. Murderous and
possibly insane. At the final battle at Golgotterath, Kelmomas betrayed his
father and brought about his death by Chorae. Kelmomas was then fed into the
Carapace and became the second incarnation of the No-God.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Mimara (4095- ), the eldest child of Esmenet, born to her by an
unknown father. During a time of famine in Sumna, Esmenet sorrowfully gave
her away so she would survive. After becoming Empress, Esmenet tracked
Mimara down and she was adopted into the House of Anasûrimbor. However,
Mimara was unable to adjust to life in the Imperial Family. Her mother refused
for her to learn sorcery and, aided by insinuations by Kelmomas, she fled the
Andiamine Heights. She sought the aid of Drusas Achamian, whom she later
seduced and became pregnant by him. She wields the Judging Eye, a powerful
and mysterious ability to discern who is good and who is evil. She survived the
final battle at Golgotterath, bearing one living child and one dead one.</p>
<p>Anasûrimbor Moënghus II (4111- ), the son of Cnaiür urs Skiötha and Serwë, born
in Caraskand during the Holy War. He was adopted by Esmenet after his
mother’s execution and then by Kellhus following the end of the war. Raised as
the oldest of the Prince Imperials, although he does not have any of Kellhus’s
blood. He marched in the Great Ordeal but was later taken prisoner by Cnaiür
and commanded to succeed him as commander of the Scylvendi in the Second
Apocalypse.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Appendix II: The Schools of Sorcery</h2>
<p>“Sorcery” or “magic” is the term given to the ability of a small number of people
(Cûnuroi and humans both) to manipulate the fabric and energies of reality through
the use of song-like incantations, stringing together phrases and words with magical
effects. These individuals are known as the Few, for their numbers are tiny in
comparison to the majority of the population, although the ability is more common
among Cûnuroi than humans. Sorcery, however, differs in its practical effects and how
it is wielded.</p>
<p>At heart, all sorcery requires the wielder to be one of the Few, to be able to perceive the
onta or very fabric of reality. They then utter audible cants (the utteral string) whilst
focusing the power with a thought (the inutteral string). These forces allow the World
to be physically shaped by the wielder into a desired outcome: desire trumps reality on a
local scale, in defiance of orthodox logic.</p>
<p>The first sorcerers were the Cûnuroi, the Nonmen. According to their tradition, they
were gifted the art by their god-founder, Imimorûl. The Nonmen Qûya, their mage-
caste, practised several forms of magic. The most frowned upon – and eventually
outlawed – was the Aporos, the art of negating sorcerous effects and destroying the
118Few. The most common and the most powerful was the Gnosis, based in reason, logic,
mathematics and knowledge.</p>
<p>The Inchoroi underestimated the power of the Gnosis, a weakness exposed at Pir Pahal
when they relied too much on their spears of light and other Tekne weapons. Although
formidable, they were outmatched by the Gnosis and the battle was lost. To level the
field, they seduced the outlawed students of the Aporos and convinced them to create
weapons based on negation . The results were the Chorae, small spheres which
destroyed the Few on contact and rendered the wielder immune to sorcery. The Chorae
were a formidable force-equaliser and helped win the great victory of Pir Minginnial but
were not sufficient to completely destroy the Nonmen; later in the Cûno-Inchoroi
Wars, the Nonmen adapted to their presence and won the great Battle of Isal’imial
despite the Inchoroi deploying significant numbers of Chorae against them. In later
years the Inchoroi grafted the ability to use sorcery onto themselves, but only a few
survived the process.</p>
<p>In Eänna beyond the Great Kayarsus, men developed their own sorcery but it was a
wild thing. Originally the role of sorcerer and prophet was combined into one, that of
Shaman. Only the Shamans could use sorcery, but it was a primitive approach, based
on superstition and ritual. This was the forerunner of the Anagogis. The Shamans were
displaced by the Prophets, non-sorcerous religious leaders who proclaimed themselves
servants of the Hundred Gods (who sent miracles and evidence of the divine, or
infernal, to show their favour or displeasure). Sorcery was outlawed and the Few driven
to the margins of society as witches and wizards even before The Chronicles of the Tusk
were compiled (with Inchoroi interference, including the command to enter Eärwa and
kill the False Men). When the Inchoroi gifted the Tusk to men, they also gave them
many Chorae, which further helped isolate the Few.</p>
<p>However, the ban on sorcery could not survive the initial clash with the Cûnuroi at the
Gates of Thayant. The howling masses of the Four Tribes far outstripped the defending
Nonmen in numbers, but the Cûnuroi could unleash the Gnosis on a massive scale,
scything down the attackers in their hundreds or thousands. Eventually male sorcerers
119were permitted to fight (but never women, who were held to be witches and anathema),
first solely as Wizards and later as organised Schools. The Anagogis was far inferior to
the Gnosis in strength, but the numbers of human wielders of the Anagogis far
outstripped those of the Gnosis. In combination with Chorae archers, they finally
overthrew the Qûya at the gates, smashed them down and swarmed into Siöl,
destroying what had once been the greatest of the Mansions.</p>
<p>The Nonmen were overthrown in four centuries of warfare, but eventually a great truce
was called in the Ancient North. Pioneered by the Nonmen of Ishoriöl and the men of
the Aumris River Valley, the two sides struck up an alliance. This led to the Nonmen
Tutelage, when the Nonmen gave men the secrets of the Gnosis and the founding of
the Gnostic mage-schools, most formidably the Mangaecca and the Sohonc.</p>
<p>During the First Apocalypse, the Gnostic schools of the North (then numbering a
dozen or so) were utterly destroyed, leaving behind only a bare handful of Gnostic
sorcerers. They founded the School of Mandate to preserve knowledge of the Gnosis,
but also to guard it against the jealous Anagogis schools of the Three Seas.
Almost as notable was the Iswazi, a form of magic rooted in the use of totemic items.
Held by some to be a derivation of the Anagogis and others to be a wholly unique form
of magic, the Iswazi gained favour in High Holy Zeüm and became the dominant form
of magic in that far land. The Iswazi is held to be superior to the Anagogis in individual
combat but inferior in massed battle, offering slightly greater raw strength but less
flexibility (due to the need for physical totems, which can be destroyed or removed).</p>
<p>Rarest of all, and believed to be a myth until the Holy War, was the Metagnosis. A
superior form of the Gnosis which uses three strings (one utteral, two inutteral) rather
than two, the Metagnosis can string together different phrases in new ways to create
vastly more formidable effects. Most notable of these is the ability to translocate (or
“teleport”) from one location to another within a line of sight (thus limited to the
horizon line), which is simply impossible otherwise. Only four practitioners of the
Metagnosis are known to history: Su’juroit, the Nonman Witch-King; Anasûrimbor
120Kellhus; his daughter, Anasûrimbor Serwa; and Apperens Saccarees, head of the School
of Mandate (although he is reported to have only uttered one of the Metagnostic cants).</p>
<p>One other form of sorcery was developed by the Fanim of Kian. The Psûkhe was a form
of sorcery completely alien to both the Gnosis and Anagogis. The Psûkhe is rooted in
emotion, passion and feeling, rather than logic (the Gnosis) or ritual (Anagogis).
Practitioners of the Psûkhe blinded themselves to better focus on feeling rather than
analysis. The Psûkhe was accounted superior to the Anagogis in strength but inferior to
the Gnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Anagogic Schools</strong></p>
<p>The Anagogic schools were founded during the Cûno-Halaroi Wars, borne out of
necessity and the need to check the power of the Nonmen Qûya despite the scriptural
condemnation of sorcerers. Although the Anagogis was far inferior to the Nonmen
Gnosis in raw power, the sheer number of sorcerers that the invaders could field more
than levelled the field.</p>
<p>The Anagogis has derivative branches, one of which is the Daimos, the art of
communing with and controlling Ciphrang. The Daimotic arts are highly dangerous
and proscribed by the Schools, but the Scarlet Spires (among others) are known to have
explored this form of magic in defiance of this tradition. Practitioners of the Gnosis
have also flirted with this form of magic (the Cûnuroi describing it as “summoning
Agencies”), but largely rejected it as too dangerous, with the summoned entity
frequently turning on its captor with violent results.</p>
<p>The Surartu (Scarlet Spires). A school of “hooded singers”, the Surartu banded together
in the Three Seas for mutual protection in the face of religious persecution. They
became a player in the politics of the Shiradi Empire, but their influence increased
markedly after the collapse of Shir during the Apocalypse. Around 2350 the rebuilt
their fortress of Kiz in Carythusal with red tiles, leading to their renaming. Eventually
121the Scarlet Spires became the ruling power of High Ainon. During the Holy War, they
fought both the Cishaurim and the Mandate, with whom they had a longstanding
dispute over control of the Gnosis. The Scarlet Spires were almost obliterated at the
Battle of Shimeh, emerging with only a dozen sorcerers-of-rank still alive. To their
humiliation, they lost control of High Ainon during the Unification Wars and it fell to
the Mandate to reassert control of the kingdom in the name of the Aspect-Emperor.</p>
<p>The Myunsai, the Mercenary School. The largest of the Anagogic Schools, the Myunsai
were founded in 3804 from the amalgamation of three minor schools during the
Scholastic Wars (the Mikka Council of Cironj, the Oarant from Nilnamesh and the
Nilitar Compact of Ce Tydonn). The Myunsai sided with the Inrithi during their
invasion of High Ainon, an act of startling hypocrisy from the Inrithi (who were
fighting to slaughter the damned sorcerers) and self-defeating stupidity from the
Myunsai. The Myunsai are noted as the Mercenary School, lending their services out
for coin.</p>
<p>The Saka, the Imperial Saik (Sorcerers of the Sun). Originally the state-sanctioned
school of the Cenei Empire, which dominated the Three Seas for a thousand years in
alliance with the Aspect-Emperors, the school survived the fall of the empire and
reconstituted itself as the Imperial Saik of the Nansur Empire. One of the larger
schools, the Imperial Saik’s numbers have been reduced by constant skirmishing with
the Cishaurim. During the Holy War the Imperial Saik suffered significant losses, but
later swore allegiance to Kellhus (alongside the Scarlet Spires and the
Mandate) and
became the core of his magical strength during the Unification Wars.
The Vokalati (Sun-Wailers). A school of sorcerers hailing from distant Nilnamesh who
have lusted for the Gnosis for two thousand years but constantly failed to seize it. Their
numbers were depleted during the Unification Wars but now they serve Anasûrimbor
Kellhus.</p>
<p><strong>Iswazi Schools</strong></p>
<p>A derivation of the Anagogis, according to some, based around the manipulation of
forces channelled through totemic artifacts. This branch of sorcery failed to find much
favour in the Three Seas or Ancient North, but did become popular in Angka (later
Zeüm).</p>
<p>The Mbimayu. The major school of Zeüm, based in Domyot, serving the Satakhan in a
similar manner to how the Imperial Saik served the Emperor of Nansur.</p>
<p><strong>Gnostic Schools</strong></p>
<p>Four Gnostic schools were founded during the Nonmen Tutelage; they were later
joined by others, so that by the time of the Apocalypse around a dozen Gnostic schools
were in existence. All bar the Sohonc and the Mangaecca were destroyed during the
Apocalypse (although the latter had long been subsumed into the Consult); the Sohonc
were effectively refounded as the Mandate by Seswatha.</p>
<p><strong>The Sohonc</strong>. The foremost and largest of the original four Gnostic schools, founded
during the Nonmen Tutelage. The Sohonc was formidable in strength and knowledge.
Its most famed grandmasters were Noshainrau (who appears to have refounded the
school in a different form circa 1050), and his successor Titirga, the Glorious Pupil and
most powerful sorcerer the World has reportedly ever seen. Its final grandmaster was
Seswatha, who led it during the First Apocalypse. Fully one third of the Sohonc were
massacred by the Chorae Hail during the First Investiture, a blunder laid at Seswatha’s
feet despite him acting on the orders of Anasûrimbor Celmomas II. Only a tiny
handful of Sohonc survived the Apocalypse and were later reconstituted as the
Mandate.</p>
<p><strong>The Mihtrûl, the School of Contrivers</strong>. Founded in 661 by the Nonman Emilidis, the
Artisan. This school invested heavily in the study and creation of sorcerous artifacts.
The Mihtrûl were destroyed during the First Apocalypse.</p>
<p><strong>The Mangaecca</strong>. Founded in 684 by Sos-Praniura (a student of Gin’yursis), the
Mangaecca was one of the original four Gnostic Schools. The Mangaecca hungered for
knowledge, secrets and historical truth. They were corrupted by the Nonman Erratic
known as Cet’ingira, who made alliance with them in 777. With his help, they
discovered the Incû-Holoinas and constructed the fortress of Golgotterath. Under their
Grandmaster Shaeonanra, the Mangaecca finally gained the Ark and discovered the
Inverse Fire and the truth of their damnation. They made alliance with the Inchoroi,
founding the Unholy Consult circa 1111. The Mangaecca effectively ceased to exist at
that point and became the Consult.</p>
<p><strong>The Mandate</strong>. Founded in 2156 by Seswatha and the few surviving Sohonc to continue
the war against the Consult and prevent the advent of the Second Apocalypse. Upon
his death Seswatha bequeathed his memories of the Apocalypse to all members of the
Mandate via the sorcerous ritual known as the Grasping. Based in Atyersus, the
Mandate protected the Gnosis for two thousand years until Drusas Achamian agreed to
teach Anasûrimbor Kellhus, who in turn commanded them to share their knowledge
with the Swayal Compact.</p>
<p><strong>The Swayal Compact, the School of Witches</strong>. Founded after 4114 at the order of
Anasûrimbor Kellhus. He rescinded all restrictions (spiritual, moral and legal) based on
gender, allowing women to join the Few. The Swayal Compact was established as a
school for these witches , to the shock of the Three Seas. Kellhus also commanded the
Mandate to share their knowledge of the Gnosis with the witches, to their reluctance.
Within just ten years, the Swayal sisters had matched the Mandate in skill and far
outstripped them in numbers, becoming the largest school in the Three Seas. At the
time of the Great Ordeal, they were led by the seventeen-year-old Anasûrimbor Serwa.
However, she earned this position on merit, due to her mastery of the Metagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Psûkari Schools</strong></p>
<p>The Psûkhe is a form of sorcery not known to exist to either Cûnuroi or humanity
prior to the 38 th Century. However, odd reports and legends surrounding those
sorcerers blinded or who had troubles with their eyesight. The Sohonc Grandmaster
Titirga, for example, had issues with his vision which have led some to believe he may
have been able to grasp the Psûkhe in a primitive fashion. This would explain both the
relative clarity of his mark and also his immense sorcerous powers, otherwise
inexplicable for someone who had not grasped the Metagnosis.</p>
<p>The Cishaurim. Founded by the Prophet Fane circa 3705. Fane had been an Inrithi
priest sentenced to die in the Carathay Desert. He went blind but gained the power of
the Water of Indara, a form of sorcery rooted in passion. The Cishaurim were all but
obliterated during the Holy War, the majority of their number (including their effective
Grandmaster, Seökti) slain by Anasûrimbor Kellhus at the Battle of Shimeh in 4112.
Only Meppa, the most powerful of the Cishaurim, survived. Meppa was defeated in
combat with Kellhus in 4132 and presumably killed, although this is not altogether
certain.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.3</span> Appendix III: Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>The First Age</strong></p>
<p>Due to a Cûnuroi lack of interest in linear chronology, no reliable calendar systems
exist during the First Age and events can only be inferred by their relationship to one
another. The principle event of this age is the Cûno-Inchoroi Wars, which some hold
began with the Arkfall but others contend began only with the Womb Plague.</p>
<p>The primary source of information for the First Age is the Isûphiryas , the Cûnuroi
living history, as well as first-hand accounts of these events from those Intact Nonmen
who witnessed them and still live.</p>
<p>Nonman Prehistory: Imimorûl is banished from the heavens and exiled to the World.
He founds Cûnuroi civilisation. Siöl and Nihrimsûl are founded. Imimorûl dies and is
succeeded by Tsonos. Siöl founds Ishoriöl, Viri, Cil-Aujas and Illisserû; they in turn
found Curunq, Cil-Aumûl and Incissal.</p>
<p><em>Millennia pass.</em></p>
<p>Thousand Year Siege: Siöl and Nihrimsûl clash over interpretations of their mutual
history and fight numerous conflicts. Eventually, an uneasy peace develops. Halaroi –
humans – appear in Eärwa and Eänna. The Cûnuroi enslave many of the Halaroi of
Eärwa for their own ends.</p>
<p>Millennia pass.</p>
<p>The Succession: Morimhira, heir to the throne of Siöl, rejects the Seal of the House
Primordial. His younger brother Cu’huriol becomes High King in his stead. Cu’huriol’s
children, Cet’moyol and Linqirû, engage in incest, resulting in the birth of Cû’jara
Cinmoi. Cu’huriol executes his incestuous children but holds the child blameless,
naming him as his own heir. Upon Cu’huriol’s death, Cû’jara Cinmoi becomes High
King of Siöl. Shortly after taking the Seal, he gains a new name: the Tyrant.</p>
<p>Decades pass.</p>
<p>Arkfall: The Incû-Holoinas, the Ark of the Skies, crashes into the western Reach of
Viri, reducing the lands of the south-western Yimaleti Mountains to a blasted
wilderness, Agongorea. Viri is devastated and calls for aid. Cû’jara Cinmoi agrees to
relieve Viri in return for its submission; King Nin’janjin reluctantly agrees. First
Contact is made with the Inchoroi, the “People of Emptiness” of the Ark. Cû’jara
Cinmoi is repelled by them and executes their emissaries. The First Watch is placed on
the Ark.</p>
<p>Years pass.</p>
<p>Siölan Expansion: Siöl conquers Nihrimsûl and Cil-Aujas after protracted campaigns.</p>
<p>Years pass.</p>
<p>The Battle of Pir Pahal: An Inchoroi embassy reaches Nin’janjin and offers him an
alliance to defeat Siöl. He agrees. The First Battle of the Ark; the First Watch is
128overthrown and the Siege of the Incû-Holoinas is lifted. The army of Viri joins that of
the Inchoroi under their dread King Sil on the Field of Pir Pahal, but the sight of the
Inchoroi revolts the Cûnuroi of Viri; they repudiate Nin’janjin, who joins the Inchoroi.
The Inchoroi turn on the Viri and nearly destroy them, but they are relieved by Cû’jara
Cinmoi’s forces. Cû’jara Cinmoi wins the battle, killing Sil and wresting the Heron
Spear from his grasp. The Inchoroi fleet in terror back to the Ark. The Second Watch
is placed on the Ark, but Cû’jara Cinmoi is prevented from attacking the Ark by news
of rebellions in Cil-Aujas and Nihrimsûl.</p>
<p>Years pass.</p>
<p>Siöl-Nihrimsûl Wars: Siöl retakes Cil-Aujas but Nihrimsûl refuses to capitulate. The
battles of Ciphara and Hilcyri are fought, along with the Siege of Asargoi. King
Sin’niroiha of Nihrimsûl sues for peace on the grounds of mutual respect, but Cû’jara
Cinmoi rejects the notion. Emilidis, the Artisan of Ishoriöl, creates the first of his
Sublime Contrivances, the Diurnal or Day Lantern, and gifts it to Sin’niroiha.
Sin’niroiha uses the artifact to win the allegiance of Ishoriöl and the hand of Tsinirû in
marriage. Hearing this news, Cû’jara Cinmoi sues for peace and ends the war.
Nil’giccas, son of Sin’niroiha and Tsinirû, is born.</p>
<p><em>Decades pass</em>. Cû’jara Cinmoi was at the height of his power when the Arkfall took
place, but by the time of the Inoculation he had grown aged and stooped. Given the
approximate lifespan of Nonmen (400 years), this suggests that between 200 and 300
years passed between Arkfall and the Inoculation.</p>
<p>The Inoculation: Nin’janjin, Traitor-King of Viri, emerges from the Incû-Holoinas and
begs for parley. He is taken to Cû’jara Cinmoi, now old and failing, who is amazed to
see that Nin’janjin has not aged a day since Pir Pahal. Nin’janjin tells of the surviving
Inchoroi dwelling in misery in the besieged Ark. He begs for peace and says the
Inchoroi will pay any price. Cû’jara Cinmoi demands the price of immortality, that the
Inchoroi give to the entire Cûnuroi race the gift they have given Nin’janjin. The
Inchoroi comply; the Second Watch is dismantled and the Inchoroi move among the
129Nonmen as their physicians. Cû’jara Cinmoi allows himself to receive the Inoculation
against death first. Many Nonmen view the treaty with disgust and suspicion, but as
they see their fellows becoming young and hale again, so they give in. Of the Ishroi
noble caste, only Sin’niroiha refuses the treatment. During this time, the Inchoroi win
a secret alliance with the Qûya mages practising the Aporos, the sorcerous art of
negation, and convince them to create the Chorae, the magic-destroying Tears of God.</p>
<p><em>One hundred years pass</em>.</p>
<p>The Womb Plague: Over one century after the Inoculation begins, the Womb Plague
consumes the Cûnuroi species. Every female to have received the Inoculation dies;
some of the aged males die as well. The Inchoroi evacuate Eärwa, falling back on the
Incû-Holoinas. Realising the depth of the Inchoroi betrayal, Cû’jara Cinmoi declares
bloody vengeance against them. He summons the armed might of all of the Nine
Mansions and marches on the Ark. According to some chronicles, the Cûno-Inchoroi
Wars (lasting over five centuries) begin with this event.</p>
<p>Battle of Pir Minginnial: The Second Battle of the Ark. Cû’jara Cinmoi’s army of thirty
thousand assaults the Ark and is defeated. The Inchoroi deploy Chorae, Wracu,
Bashrags and Sranc for the first time in battle, wrecking a bloody slaughter amongst the
attacking force. Cû’jara Cinmoi is slain by Nin’janjin. Sin’niroiha manages to withdraw
the army before its destruction.</p>
<p>Sieges of Ishoriöl: Ishoriöl is besieged five times, each for more than a decade. During
the Siege of the Second Delve, Sin’niroiha finally succumbed to old age (the last
Nonman to die of simple mortality) and was succeeded by his son Nil’giccas. As a Son
of Tsonos through his mother’s line, Nil’giccas was able to rally the Nonmen as his
father could not.</p>
<p>Battle of Imogirion: The southern Mansion of Illisserû mounts a surprise attack on the
Ark by sea. The battle turns into a fiasco, the army destroyed and the remnants
130attacked by Sranc on Agongorea in a nocturnal slaughter. Only one Illisserû warrior
lives to see home.</p>
<p>Battle of Isal’imial: The Third Battle of the Ark. Five centuries after the debacle of Pir
Minginnial and spurred by reports of the failing Inchoroi weapon systems, Nil’giccas
convinces the Mansions to mount a massive assault on the Incû-Holoinas. They agree
and a hard-pitched battle is won on the Black Furnace Plain. The victory is so complete
that the Sranc are sent reeling back into the Yimaleti Mountains, with the Cûnuroi
hunting them to near extinction, whilst the Inchoroi are (apparently) completely
exterminated. For the first and only time in history, the Incû-Holoinas is stormed by an
attacking force. Nin’janjin is taken prisoner.</p>
<p>The Cleansing of the Ark: For twenty years, the Cûnuroi explore, burn out and seek to
destroy the Ark, but are unsuccessful. They partially loot the Ark, using material from it
to reinforce the gates of Ishoriöl and also to seal all but one portal into the vessel. The
Golden Room and the Inverse Fire are discovered, driving all who attempt to
comprehend it insane. At this time Cet’ingira beholds the Fire and becomes convinced
of the righteousness of the Inchoroi’s cause, but manages to hide his conversion.
Deeply troubled, Nil’giccas has the Ark evacuated and sealed. He commands Emilidis
to raise a glamour about the Ark, rendering it inaccessible. Emilidis complies, creating
the Barricades. All mention of the Inverse Fire is stricken from the Isûphiryas .
Nin’janjin vanishes from history, but is presumably executed.</p>
<p>Millennia pass.</p>
<p>The Time of the Shamans: In Eänna, the sorcerer-priests known as Shamans arise
among the Halaroi tribes. Using the magic of the Anagogis, they guide the tribes of
men to greater wisdom in their worship of the God-of-Gods, but in time are opposed by
the Prophets, non-sorcerous servants of the Hundred Gods. The Hundred Gods,
through their Prophets, declare that sorcerers are damned to hell. Religious
proscriptions on sorcery are commanded and the Shamans are hounded to the fringes
of civilisation, reduced to solitary witches and wizards surviving in secret or the
131forbearance of close allies. The Kiünnat religious tradition becomes dominant,
reducing the God-of-Gods to a divine placeholder and extolling the Hundred.</p>
<p>Centuries pass.</p>
<p>The Deliverance of the Tusk: The Chronicle of the Tusk is written: the great stories
and myths of humankind inscribed on the huge tusk of a monstrous, long-dead animal.
According to later history, The Chronicle was written in Eänna by the Prophets; in
reality, it was gifted to the Five Tribes – along with Chorae – by strangers out of the
west. Notable in The Tusk is a command to “kill the False Men” of Eärwa.</p>
<p>Centuries pass.</p>
<p>The Summoning of the Tribes: Angeshraël, the Burned Prophet, has a profound
revelation when encountering Husyelt, God of the Hunt, at the foot of Mount Eshki.
He summons representatives of the Five Tribes to Mount Kinsureah. He urges them to
fulfil the command of the Tusk to exterminate the False Men. In the end four of the
Five Tribes – the Norsirai, Satyothi, Scylvendi and Ketyai – hearken to the call, with
only the Xiuhianni resisting.</p>
<p>Years pass.</p>
<p>The Testing of the Gates: The first assaults are made on the Gate of Thayant, the
Cûnuroi fortification in the northern Great Kayarsus Mountains which bars the largest
pass linking Eärwa and Eänna. These assaults are unsuccessful, with the tribes unable to
overcome the Qûya of Siöl whose Gnostic magic is too powerful. After lengthy religious
and secular arguments, the religious proscription on sorcery is relaxed; human wizards
and warlocks are recruited to help check the Cûnuroi Qûya. The first schools of sorcery
are established.</p>
<p>Years pass.</p>
<p>The Breaking of the Gates: With the help of sorcery, the Four Tribes shatter the Gate
of Thayant and destroy the Nonman Mansion of Siöl. They spill from its great gates
onto the plains of far north-eastern Eärwa, their promised land. The Cûno-Halaroi
Wars begin. Recorded history begins.</p>
<p><strong>The Second Age</strong></p>
<p>0: The Breaking of the Gates and the beginning of the Cûno-Halaroi Wars, a
series of military conflicts between Man and Nonman lasting over 300 years.
Also, the beginning of the Age of Bronze, or Far Antiquity.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>300: By this time the Jiünati Steppe has been settled by the Scylvendi and Angka has
been settled by the Satyothi. By this time Trysë, Sauglish, Etrithatta (sometimes
called just Etrith) and Ûmerau have been established along the River Aumris by
the Norsirai tribe. Tentative trade between the river valley cities and the
Nonmen of Ishoriöl (Ishterebinth) have begun.</p></li>
<li><p>350: Cûnwerishau, the God-King of Trysë, unites the River Aumris cities. He and
Nil’giccas, King of Ishterebinth, sign a treaty. Effective end of the Cûno-Halaroi
Wars; Ishterebinth and Cil-Aujas are the sole High Mansions to survive. The
first copy of the Isûphiryas is given to humans as part of the treaty, leading to

Empire. A number of Hamori Ketyai tribes settle the length of the River
Sayut and the Secharib Plains, becoming more sedentary and socially stratified
as they exploit the rich cereal yields afforded by the fertile soils of the
region. Seto-Annaria, as it came to be called (after the two most dominant
tribes), remains a collection of warring city-states.</p></li>

<p>1556: Anasûrimbor Nanor-Ukkerja I dies at age 178, his long life reputedly the result
of the Nonman blood in his veins. In the 148 years of his reign, he had
extended Kûniüri to the Yimaleti Mountains in the north, to the westernmost
coasts of the Cerish Sea in the east, to Sakarpus in the south, and to the Demua
Mountains in the west. At his death, he divided this empire between his sons,

<p><strong>The Apocalypse (2123-2155)</strong></p>
<p>2123: Nonman Siqû inform the Grandmaster of the Sohonc that the Mangaecca,
or Consult as they had come to be called, had uncovered lost Inchoroi secrets
that would lead to the world’s destruction. Seswatha in turn convinced
Anasûrimbor Celmomas to declare war on Golgotterath, known as the Great
Ordeal.</p>
<p>2124: The Great Ordeal battle Consult forces on the Plains of Agongorea. The battle
is indecisive. Celmomas and his allies winter in Dagliash.</p>
<p>2125: The following spring, the Great Ordeal ford the River Sursa, catching their foe
unawares. The Consult withdraw to Golgotterath, and so begin what would be
called the First Investiture. For six years the Ordeal attempt to starve the
Consult into submission, to no avail. Every assault proves disastrous.</p>
<p>2131: Celmomas abandons the Holy War following a dispute with King Nimeric of
Aörsi.</p>
<p>2132: Consult legions, apparently utilizing a vast subterranean network of tunnels,
appear in the Ring Mountains to the rear of the Ordeal. The coalition host is all
139but destroyed. Embittered by the loss of his sons, Nil’giccas, the Nonman King
of Ishterebinth, withdraws altogether, leaving the Aörsi to war alone.</p>
<p>2133: The Aörsi are defeated at the Passes of Amnerlot, and Dagliash was lost soon
after. King Nimeric withdraws to his capital of Shiarau.</p>
<p>2134: Burning of the White Ships; falling back before the Consult legions,
Anasûrimbor Nimeric dispatches the Aörsic fleet to shelter in the Kûniüri port
of Aesorea. Mere days after its arrival, it is burned by agents unknown.
Celmomas acknowledges his folly and mobilizes to relieve Aörsi King Nimeric
at Shiarau.</p>
<p>2135: Anasûrimbor Nimeric is mortally wounded in the Battle of Hamuir, and dies at
age 43.</p>
<p>2136: Shiarau capital of Aörsi falls in spring, and Aörsi is destroyed. The Worldhorn,
a ceremonial sorcerous artifact, is lost with Shiarau.</p>
<p>2137: Nau-Cayûti manages to rout the Consult at the Battle of Ossirish, where he
earns the name Murswagga, or “Dragonslayer,” for killing Tanhafut the Red.
His next victory, within sight of Shiarau’s ruins, is more complete still. The
Consult’s remaining Sranc and Bashrag flee across the River Sursa.</p>
<p>2139: Nau-Cayûti besieges and recaptures Dagliash, and launches several spectacular
raids across the Plains of Agongorea.</p>
<p>2140: Nau-Cayûti’s beloved concubine, Aulisi, is abducted by Sranc marauders and
taken to Golgotterath. According to The Sagas Seswatha, after consulting the
Amiolas and the wisdom of Ishterebinth, is able to convince the Prince (who
was once his student) that she can be rescued from the Incû-Holoinas, and the
two of them embark on an expedition that is almost certainly apocryphal.
Mandate commentators dispute the account found in The Sagas , where they
successfully return with both Aulisi and the Heron Spear, claiming that Aulisi
was never found. Whatever happened, at least two things are certain: the Heron
Spear was in fact recovered, and Nau-Cayûti apparently died shortly after at age
21. He is actually poisoned by his first wife, Iëva (later executed for the crime)
and only given the semblance of death. He is retrieved by Aurang and borne to
Golgotterath, where he is tortured for his knowledge of the Heron Spear.</p>
<p>2141: The Consult return to the offensive. At the Battle of Skothera, the Sranc hordes
are crushed by General En-Kaujalau, though he died of mysterious causes
within weeks of this victory (according to The Sagas , he was another victim of
Iëva and her poisons, but again this is disputed by Mandate scholars).</p>
<p>2142: General Sag-Marmau inflicts yet another crushing defeat on Aurang and his
Consult legions, and by fall he had hounded the remnant of their horde to the
Gates of Golgotterath itself. This siege is known as the Second Great
Investiture. During the early part of the Investiture, sixty-one Sohonc sorcerers
(more than a third of the School) are killed in the Chorae Hail.</p>
<p>2143: In spring the No-God is summoned: Initiation. Across the world, Sranc,
Bashrag, and Wracu, all the obscene progeny of the Inchoroi, hearkened to his
call. Sag-Marmau and the greater glory of Kûniüri are annihilated. All Men
could sense his dread presence on the horizon, and all infants were born dead.
The 11 years when all infants were still born comes to be known as the Years of
the Crib. Anasûrimbor Celmomas II had little difficulty gathering support for
his Second Ordeal. Nil’giccas and Celmomas were reconciled. Across Eärwa,
hosts of Men began marching toward Kûniüri.</p>
<p>2146: Battle of Eleneöt Fields is fought between the Horde of the No-God and the
Second Ordeal on Kûniüri’s northeastern frontier. Despite having assembled
the greatest host of their age, Anasûrimbor Celmomas and his allies are
unprepared for the vast numbers of Sranc, Bashrag, and Wracu gathered by the
No-God and his Consult slaves. The battle is an unmitigated catastrophe,
signaling the eventual destruction of Norsirai civilization. With his dying words
Anasûrimbor Celmomas II predicts the return of an Anasûrimbor at “the end
of the world” to Seswatha. This would come to be known as the Celmomian
Prophecy. Celmomas II dies at age 57. The Heron Spear, which could not be
used because the No-God refused to give battle, was lost. Anasûrimbor
Ganrelka II becomes the last reigning High King of Kûniüri.</p>
<p>2147: All the ancient cities of the Aumris are destroyed, including Trysë and
Sauglish. Four Ûmeri copies of the Isûphiryas were destroyed along with the
Library of Sauglish. The fifth is saved by Seswatha, who later delivered it to the
scribes of the Three Seas. The surviving Kûniüri are either enslaved or scattered. Ganrelka II, last reigning High King of Kûniüri dies at age 43, ending
the Anasûrimbor Dynasty. Ginsil, wife of General En-Kaujalau, dies at age
32. The Nonmen of Injor-Niyas retreat to Ishterebinth and stand siege.
Seswatha is captured during the fall of Trysë and pinned to the Wall of the
Dead at Dagliash, where he is tortured by Cet’ingira for knowledge of the
Heron Spear. Seswatha resists interrogation and escapes.</p>
<p>2148: Eämnor is laid waste, though its capital, Atrithau, survived.</p>
<p>2149: Akksersia, including the capital, Myclai, falls after three disastrous
defeats. Harmant falls as well. Siege of Ishterebinth is raised after the No-God is
repulsed from the Minror Gates, possibly due to the soggomant from the Ark
used to reinforce them.</p>
<p>2150: Kelmeöl falls and the Meöri Empire falls with it.</p>
<p>2151: Inweära falls, though the city of Sakarpus was spared. In autumn, the remnant
Meöri and the Nonmen of Cil-Aujas are victorious against the Consult at
the Battle of Kathol Pass.</p>
<p>2152: In spring, the Meöri turn on their benefactors and sack the ancient Nonman
Mansion of Cil-Aujas.</p>
<p>2153: Forces of the No-God inflict a disastrous defeat on the Shiradi at the Battle of
Nurubal. The next two hundred years of chaos and internecine warfare
effectively destroyed what remained of the Shiradi Empire and its central
institutions.</p>
<p>2154: The Battle of Mehsarunath is fought between the Kyraneas and the host of the
No-God on the Attong Plateau. Aurang, the No-God’s Horde-General, won the
battle, but the Kyranean High King, Anaxophus V, is able to escape with much
of his host intact. He abandoned Mehtsonc and Sumna to the Scylvendi. The
Tusk is evacuated and brought to Ancient Invishi in Nilnamesh. Mehtsonc is
destroyed, sealing the fate of Kyraneas. Anaxophus V reveals to Seswatha that
he rescued the Heron Spear from the Fields of Eleneöt in 2146.</p>
<p>2155: The Second Battle of Mengedda, Anaxophus V and his southern tributaries and
allies make their victorious stand against the Horde of the No-God. Seswatha
slays Skafra the Wracu. Wielding the Heron Spear Anaxophus V strikes down
the No-God. Free of his terrible will, his Sranc, Bashrag, and Wracu slaves
disperse. Pestilence swept up from the No-God after his defeat causing
the Indigo Plague, one of the worst in recorded history. The end of the
Apocalypse marks the end of Far Antiquity, and the beginning of Near
Antiquity.</p>
<p><strong>Near Antiquity (2156-3351)</strong></p>
<p>2156: Anaxophus V, Kyranean High King, dies at age 47. Seswatha founds the School
of Mandate.</p>

even managed to hold the far southern city of Invishi (though he failed to
entirely subdue the Nilnameshi countryside). Despite his military successes, his
continual wars exhausted both the Nansur people and the Imperial Treasury
and his practice of debasing the talent in order to finance the wars wrecked the
empire’s economy. This inadvertently lay the groundwork for the disastrous
wars against the Kianene following his death.</p>
