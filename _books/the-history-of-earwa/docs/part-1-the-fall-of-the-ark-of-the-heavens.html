<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Part 1: The Fall of the Ark of the Heavens</h1>
<p>Before the dawn of antiquity, well over five thousand years ago, the lands of Eärwa were the domain of a beautiful, ancient and long-lived race. They called themselves the ji’cûnû roi (or, more familiarly, Cûnuroi), the People of the Dawn. Men, not known for their flights of imagination, would later call them Oserukki, “Not Us”, or in everyday parlance, the Nonmen. The origins of the Cûnuroi are lost to speculation and debate, but in their mythology their civilisation was established by the Ur-King Imimorûl (who may or may not have been a god himself), who fled from the Heavens to seek sanctuary far below the ground, away from the watchful eyes of jealous gods and the hungry sky. He removed his shield-arm and used its bones to create the first Nonmen.</p>
<p>The Cûnuroi in those days were not immortal, but their lifespans were measured at over four centuries. They raised great citadels - mansions - within the mountains of Eärwa and forged mighty artifacts and items of glorious beauty. They were the first to master the art of sorcery through their Qûya mages. Their noble-warrior caste, the Ishroi, became renowned for their absolute mastery of combat. The Cûnuroi did not give up their long lives lightly in battle, but from time to time strife was incurred and the mansions would go to war. But for the most part they lived in peace.</p>
<p>At first, they paid little heed to the savage race of fur-clad primitives who spread across
Eärwa, dwelling in the forests and between the mountain peaks. They called this race
j’ala roi (more familiarly, Halaroi), the People of Summer, for their lives were fleeting
but flamed so hot and passionate. But as the Halaroi spread in number, breeding at a
far faster rate than the slow-burning Cûnuroi, the Nonmen saw the wisdom in
subduing the interlopers. The Nonmen Mansions broke the spirit of these men,
reducing them to becoming the Emwama, a tribute race who existed as slaves of the
Cûnuroi. They delved the deep mines for their long-lived masters and tilled the fields
for them. The sole exception was in the uttermost north, where the Cûnuroi of Viri
instead employed men and treated them with more respect, to the derision of their
peers.</p>
<p>The number of Nonmen Mansions is unknown, although it is known that the
mightiest and oldest, the High Mansions, numbered nine. The greatest, most powerful
and most populous (at least originally) was Siöl, located deep under the northern Great
Kayarsus Mountains, defending a series of fortified passes leading east into Eänna, a
land of primitive Halaroi tribes which the Nonmen harvested for slaves. The proudest
and most fiercely independent was Nihrimsûl, located under the south-eastern Yimaleti
Mountains. Cil-Aujas lay in the east, under the peak of Aenaratiol at the south tip of
the Osthwai Mountains. Ishoriöl, the Exalted Hall, lay in the far west, beyond the
Demua Mountains near the shores of the Great Ocean. Viri lay underneath the peak of
Antareg in the Urokkas, a small range of mountains overlooking the Sea of Neleöst, the
Misty Sea. Illisserû, the Lighthouse, was located in the Betmulla Mountains overlooking
the Sea of Meneanor, with Curunq under the Araxes Mountains of the east and Cil-
Aumûl under the Hinayati Mountains of the far south. Western-most of the Nine was
Incissal, located under hills near the Great Ocean.</p>
<p>Siöl claimed to be the oldest Mansion, the House Primordial, founded directly by
Imimorûl himself at the dawn of days. This claim was disputed by Nihrimsûl, who
instead claimed to be the true House Primordial. In the Nihrimsûli tradition it is said
that Imimorûl discovered his son Tsonos and daughter Olissis engaged in a passionate
relationship and was angered. Fearful of his wrath, the children murdered their father
and fled to find safety in the Deepest Deeps beneath the Kayarsus, where they
established Siöl. In the Siölan version, Imimorûl founded Siöl himself and died
peacefully, with Tsonos succeeding him. Nihrimsûl was founded by a lesser child of
Imimorûl, with inferior blood. Theological disputes arose from these disagreements
which in turn led to war: at one stage Nihrimsûl endured the so-called Thousand Year
Siege before an uneasy peace was made.</p>
<p>Siöl founded Ishoriöl, Viri, Illisserû and Cil-Aujas as colonies, and they in turned
foundedOf the Nine, much could be said: Ishoriöl, the Exalted Hall (which in more recent
times men have called Ishterebinth) waxed quickly, its cultural and economic power
impressing even Siöl. Illisserû was the one Mansion to be built overlooking the sea and
whose people built vessels to sail on the water, and its people soon became regarded as
strange for this obsession. But of the Nine, few could rival Viri in tragedy and
misfortune.</p>

whose people built vessels to sail on the water, and its people soon became regarded as
strange for this obsession. But of the Nine, few could rival Viri in tragedy and
misfortune.</p>
<p>Viri controlled a great swath of territory. Its dominion extended across either side of
the River Sursa, reaching north and westwards through thickly-forested lands to the
frigid and massive Yimaleti Mountains and eastwards around the curving shoreline of
the Misty Sea. Many Halaroi dwelt in these lands, but the Cûnuroi of Viri treated with
them and bartered for their service, to the amusement of their southern kin. The
Nonmen of Viri nevertheless lived peacefully and prosperously. Until the waxing of
Imburil.</p>
<p>Imburil, the Newborn, was the name given by the Cûnuroi to the pole star, the
brightest star in the sky. Men would later call it the Nail of Heaven, the star around
which all others turned. One night the star suddenly blazed with a strange, sudden
intensity. This waxing lasted a long time and then abated. The Cûnuroi could not
explain it, but then dismissed it as a curiosity and moved on with their lives.</p>
<p>Three years after this curious event, death came swirling down.
A colossal crack sounded around the world, briefly shaking even the foundations of Cil-
Aujas some two thousand miles to the south-east. The skies turned red as far away as
Siöl, and it was clear that something momentous had happened in the far north-
western corner of Eärwa, in the southern reaches of the Yimaleti Mountains.</p>
<p>The Nonmen of Viri had a far closer view.</p>
<p>There, the shaking came as terrific, terrible waves of destruction. Some of the lower
halls of the mansion collapsed. Passages caved in and the great mines were laid waste.
Tens of thousands of Cûnuroi were killed. Some, in desperation, attempted to flee the
mansion altogether. Those who did beheld - briefly - a firestorm sweeping out of the
west, destroying all before it. The great forests of western Viri were vapourised, the
farmlands obliterated and the outer walls of the mansion scorched.</p>
<p>The devastation was total and the intensity of its fury was terrifying: Viri was still
hundreds of miles from where the cataclysm had taken place. Almost equidistant was
Ishoriöl, which lay to the south-west of the Yimaleti Mountains beyond the Leash, the
long straits linking the Great Ocean to the Misty Sea. Ishoriöl was luckier, however.
The south-western Yimaleti Mountains and the hills around Ishoriöl helped deflect the worst of the damage away. Furthermore, the fertile hinterlands of Ishoriöl - Injor-Niyas -
were located further to the south and were not affected by the cataclysm. Although
damaged, Ishoriöl was able to recover quickly without outside help.</p>
<p>The same was not true of Viri. Its rich tributary lands had been utterly destroyed, its
population reduced catastrophically. Its few surviving Halaroi client-tribes were reduced
to begging at the gates of Viri for aid. Foreseeing disaster, King Nin’janjin sent word to
Siöl, greatest of the mansions and requested succour from King Cû’jara Cinmoi, the
greatest Cûnuroi ruler of the age.</p>
<p>The Sky has cracked into potter’s shards,
Fire sweeps the compass of Heaven,
The beasts flee, their hearts maddened,
The trees fall, their backs broken.
Ash has shrouded all sun, choked all seed,
The Halaroi howl piteously at the Gates,
Dread Famine stalks my Mansion.
Brother Siöl, Viri begs your pardon.</p>
<p>Cû’jara Cinmoi read the message and realised he had no choice but to act: his armies
swept across the borders of Viri and invaded the territory of Nin’janjin. Incredulous but
unable to resist, Nin’janjin chose subjugation. He allowed the forces of Siöl to occupy
his kingdom without giving battle. It was humiliating, but it also saved his mansion.
The forces of Siöl prevented its extinction, for the price of its sovereignty.</p>
<p>His bloodless victory assured, Cû’jara Cinmoi turned his eye west to where the
cataclysm had taken place. The land was still scarred and blackened, but the immediate
firestorm had burned out and the way was passable, for someone with the will. Cû’jara
Cinmoi chose Ingalira, a great hero of Siöl, and sent him into the heart of the storm to
learn what had transpired.</p>
<p>Ingalira returned to Viri three months later with his report, which was hard to fathom.
According to him, a great golden vessel had been responsible for the devastation. It had
fallen from the sky with great speed and crashed into the mountains with tremendous
force. A vast circular depression had been created by the impact, with a new range of
peaks, the Occlusion or Ring Mountains, thrown up around its edges. Most of the
vessel was buried underground, with only two titanic golden horns – one upright, the other canted – reaching miles skywards from the site of impact, now a boiling cauldron
of molten rock. This vessel was dubbed the Incû-Holoinas , the Ark-of-the-Skies. Ingalira
attempted an exploration of the vessel, but its inhabitants – with their clam-shaped,
skull-like heads and hooked wings – were unpleasant to look upon and made noises
devoid of meaning. For this reason, and the fact that they came from the empty skies,
they were dubbed the Inchoroi , or People of Emptiness. Ingalira brought two of these
creatures back with him, but Cû’jara Cinmoi was so revolted by their aspect that he had
them slain on the spot.</p>
<p>History may have been better served had the Cûnuroi marched on the Ark
immediately, but Cû’jara Cinmoi had already seen a greater opportunity afforded by
the Arkfall. His forces bolstered by the survivors of Viri, he chose instead to make war.
His armies marched on Cil-Aujas and Nihrimsûl and subdued both in battle.
Sin’niroiha, King of Nihrimsûl, the ancient rival of Siöl, was forced to wash Cû’jara
Cinmoi’s sword as a sign of supplication. Cû’jara Cinmoi became the High King of
Four Mansions, his Reach extending from the Yimaleti Mountains to the Sea of
Meneanor and from the Great Kayarsus to the Demua range. The might of Siöl was
uncontested.</p>
<p>The skies above the Incû-Holoinas cleared and the lands cooled. Western Viri had been
reduced to a wasteland, Agongorea , the Field Appalling, which stretched from the edges
of the Ring Mountains to the River Sursa, under the very walls of Viri. Nothing would
grow there and nothing could live there. Not even footsteps would make a mark on the
dead ground. Viri’s power and might had been exhausted, even before its conquest by
Siöl. Nin’janjin brooded on Cû’jara Cinmoi’s betrayal and the reduction of his
mansion, and dreamt of vengeance.</p>
<p>A Watch had been placed on the Incû-Holoinas. The Ark was ringed by sentries and
forts, but somehow a delegation of Inchoroi slipped through their lines. They came to
Nin’janjin in secrecy and spoke to him, but this time in the Ihrimsû tongue of the
Cûnuroi. The Inchoroi could now speak through faces they had somehow grafted into
their mouths. They claimed that the descent of their vessel was uncontrolled and the devastation suffered by Viri unplanned. They regretted the cataclysm and offered to
make amends. The Inchoroi would make alliance with Viri and stand with them
against Siöl. They would give Nin’janjin the power to avenge Cû’jara Cinmoi’s
treachery. Against the advice of many of his Ishroi and Qûya advisors and despite his
own misgivings, Nin’janjin agreed.</p>
<p>Viri revolted. The Siölan occupation forces were slaughtered or enslaved. The Inchoroi
swarmed from the Ark under the command of their king, Sil, and overthrew the Watch
in the First Battle of the Ark. Only the two great twin heroes of Siöl, Oirinas and
Oirûnas, survived to relate news of the peril to Cû’jara Cinmoi. The High King
gathered his armies and marched north-west to meet the threat on the field of Pir-
Pahal, south-east of the Sea of Neleöst. Nin’janjin assembled the might of Viri there to
await them. However, when the Inchoroi host arrived the Ishroi of Viri became
disturbed, for the Inchoroi wore festering bodies as garments of war. Their obscene
appearance offended the Cûnuroi of Viri as it had Cû’jara Cinmoi. The warrior
Gin’gûrima confronted Nin’janjin and realised that the king’s desire for vengeance and
redress had overthrown his reason. “Hate has blinded him!” he cried, and soon most of
the host of Viri had taken up the cry. They refused to fight alongside the Inchoroi. The
Inchoroi, fearing that the Nonmen planned to join Cû’jara Cinmoi and turn on them,
attacked first, hoping to destroy them ere the arrival of the might of Siöl.</p>
<p>The battle was hard-fought, the Cûnuroi valour and skill at arms and sorcery proving a
match for the Inchoroi’s weapons of light, which scythed through their ranks with
abandon. The Inchoroi would have likely won regardless, but the Nonmen of Viri only
had to hold back the threat until the armies of Siöl arrived. Finding his once-vassals
beleaguered, Cû’jara Cinmoi threw himself into the fray.</p>
<p>The battle lasted a day and a night. The armies of Siöl were tested by the Inchoroi
weapons but triumphed. Cû’jara Cinmoi himself faced and defeated Sil, slaying him
where he stood and seizing his weapon, Sûrgoil, “Shining Death”, which in a later age
men would call the Heron Spear. The Inchoroi broke and ran, fleeing back to the Incû-
Holoinas. The Cûnuroi followed, planning to destroy them once and for all, but word
came of disasters in distant corners of the Siölan empire: Cil-Aujas and Nihrimsûl had
revolted and broken free of the yoke of Siöl. Believing the Inchoroi broken and
finished, Cû’jara Cinmoi ordered Oirinas and Oirûnas to return to the Ark and set a
renewed Watch on it. Cû’jara Cinmoi then took the bulk of his forces back east to
retake the rebellious mansions. He won back Cil-Aujas in a hard campaign, but
Nihrimsûl and its king, Sin’niroiha, refused to concede. Battle after battle was fought,
to no avail.</p>
<p>Dozens of bloody battles resulted to no end, but proud Cû’jara Cinmoi refused to treat
until Sin’niroiha became King of Ishoriöl through marriage to the sorceress Tsinirû,
having won the right to wield the fabled Diurnal or Day Lantern from Emilidis, the
Artisan. Hearing the news, Cû’jara Cinmoi relented and sent a message to the High
King of Nihrimsûl and Ishoriöl: “A King of Three Mansions may be Brother to a King
of Two.”</p>
<p>During this time Cû’jara Cinmoi had been forced to denude the Second Watch of
Cûnuroi warriors. To replace them, Oirinas and Oirûnas recruited from the primitive
tribes of men. Among them was Sirwatta, a man who had seduced the wife of a high-
ranking Ishroi and gotten her with child, a daughter named Cimoira. Cimoira was
raised as a Cûnuroi but Sirwatta was banished to the Watch. During his exile, he chose
to enter the Ark. He disappeared for a month and was assumed dead, but then
emerged, deranged and speaking stories so worrying that he was borne directly to
Cû’jara Cinmoi. What news was related was unknown and Sirwatta was ordered to be
put to death. By other accounts, this order was rescinded and Sirwatta merely had his
tongue removed.</p>
<p>More years passed and Cû’jara Cinmoi grew old and infirm. His eyesight dimmed and
the end seemed to approach. At this time Nin’janjin returned, begging Mercy and
Penance as per the ancient codes. Cû’jara Cinmoi granted him audience, but was
amazed to see that Nin’janjin had not aged a day since he last saw him on the Field of
Pir-Pahal, many decades earlier. Nin’janjin confirmed that the science of the Inchoroi
preserved him. He told Cû’jara Cinmoi that the Inchoroi lived in stark terror of the
might of Siöl, so remained in the Ark in misery. They begged to sue for peace.
Nin’janjin asked what tribute they could pay to temper the High King’s fury.</p>
<p>The High King said, fatefully, “I would be young of heart, face and limb. I would banish
Death from the halls of my people”. His counsellors urged him otherwise, but Cû’jara
Cinmoi had seen Nin’janjin’s vigour and it awoke in him a greed for the return of his
own youth and strength. The Second Watch was disbanded and the Inchoroi allowed
to minister to the Nonmen of Siöl as their physicians. This began the time of the
Inoculation.</p>
<p>The Inchoroi gave the treatments and ministrations to the Cûnuroi that would both
bless them with immortality and doom them. Soon their effectiveness became clear, as
the Cûnuroi of Siöl grew in strength and skill, their youth restored to them. The other
Mansions abhorred the Inchoroi, but the fear of death gripped them all one. One by one, they gave in and allowed the Inchoroi to practice their arts on them as well. Only
the High King Sin’niroiha refused.</p>
<p>After a century, all seemed well and the power of the Cûnuroi waxed again, until
Hanalinqû, the legendary wife of Cû’jara Cinmoi, died of an affliction. The Inchoroi
strove to save her, to no avail and Cû’jara Cinmoi praised their diligence. But soon
other Cûnuroi women started to die, first a few and then scores. The Inchoroi fled en
masse , abandoning the mansions to return to the Ark. Cû’jara Cinmoi realised with
horror that he and his entire race had been deceived, and poisoned. The Womb-Plague,
as it was called, consumed the entire race and killed every single woman it touched.
Within a few scant years fully half of the Cûnuroi species had been murdered, and the
ability of it to reproduce removed, forever.</p>
<p>Cû’jara Cinmoi called for a muster of arms like nothing before seen in Eärwa. Not just
the mansions under his control, but every stronghold of the Nonmen between the
Yimaleti Mountains and the shores of the Three Seas in the uttermost south
responded. The might of the Nine High Mansions assembled. Cû’jara Cinmoi led this
army through the Occlusion and onto the Inniür-Shigogli, the Black Furnace Plain that
lay about the Golden Horns of the Incû-Holoinas. There he laid down the body of his
slain wife and demanded that the Inchoroi answer for their crimes.</p>
<p>But the Inchoroi had prepared for this day. For many long years they had practiced foul
skills, melding technology and flesh to create hordes of horrific servants: Sranc, a
piteous abomination of Cûnuroi, given to obscene hungers of the flesh; powerful
Bashrags, tall, fierce and hideous warriors of tremendous size and strength; and Wracu,
winged beasts whom men would later call dragons. These boiled forth to assail the
Cûnuroi on the day later known as Pir Minginnial.</p>
<p>The Cûnuroi may have yet carried the day, for their numbers were immense (thirty
thousand at the very least), their shields tall and their sorcery strong. But the Inchoroi
had seduced the Qûya practitioners of the Aporos, the form of sorcery focused on
negation . These sorcerers had created for the Inchoroi devices they called Chorae ,
trinkets, later called by men “Tears of God”. Each Chorae was a small iron sphere,
banded in runes inscribed in the Qûya language and one inch in diameter. Anyone
wearing a Chorae was rendered immune to sorcery. If a Chorae came into contact with
a sorcerer, it killed them instantly, transforming their bodies into pillars of salt. The
Chorae turned the tide of battle, slaughtering the Qûya by the dozens and reducing the
struggle to one of swords, teeth and talons.</p>
<p>The heroes of Eärwa struck back. Ciögli the Mountain, strongest of the Ishroi, broke
the neck of Wutteät the Black, the Father of Dragons (although he survived). Oirinas
and Oirûnas fought side-by-side, slaughtering Sranc and Bashrags by the score. Ingalira
strangled Vshikcrû, one of the mightiest of the Inchoroi, and cast his burning body
down. The Cûnuroi would not relent and would not yield.</p>
<p>The battle only turned when Nin’janjin, his hatred not dimmed by the passage of
generations, found and battled Cû’jara Cinmoi. He slew the High King of Siöl and
sundered his head from his body. The mighty Gin’gûrima fell, gored to death by a
Wracu. Oirinas was slain by an Inchoroi spear of light. Sin’niroiha, the High King of
Nihrimsûl and Ishoriöl, rallied the surviving Nonmen (retrieving the Heron Spear
along the way) and they began a fighting retreat, withdrawing to the Ring Mountains.</p>
<p>The Inchoroi, despite their hordes of slave-servants and their Chorae, were reluctant to
pursue. They had suffered grievous losses. The Black Furnace Plain was covered in the
bodies of Sranc, Bashrags, Wracu and Inchoroi themselves. The Inchoroi chose not to
pursue their foe but to regroup.</p>
<p>This proved to be a mistake, although at first it did not seem so. The Cûnuroi retreated
to their mansions to raise fresh troops, but they could not replenish their losses. The
Inchoroi bred countless more Sranc and Bashrags to throw at their foe, and the Isûphiryas , the record of Cûnuroi history, recorded nothing but defeat after defeat for
decades. Most famed of these was the Battle of Imogirion, when the Cûnuroi of
Illisserû launched a daring raid on the Incû-Holoinas by sea. Despite the bravery of the
move and taking the Inchoroi by surprise, the attacking force was defeated in a
nocturnal slaughter on Agongorea. Less than a hundred warriors survived to return to
their ships and only one survived the storms of the voyage to see home again.</p>
<p>But the Inchoroi were also a dying race: they could also not replenish their losses, and
every Inchoroi that fell was a major victory for the Cûnuroi. And the Cûnuroi were,
even in their reduced state, far more numerous.</p>
<p>The Inchoroi were also overly reliant on their weapons of light and their technology,
but these were reliant on the Ark and the Ark seemed to be failing. One-by-one, the
Inchoroi spears of light ceased working. Their other weapons likewise failed, and their
ability to create countless Wracu, Sranc and Bashrags became reduced. They were
forced to let the creatures breed instead, and this was a slower process.</p>
<p>Politics also worked in the Inchoroi’s favour, at least at first. Sin’niroiha was not of the
Blood of Tsonos, the line of Nonman descent from Imimorûl’s eldest son, and even in
this time of great need the other mansions were reluctant to follow his lead. Even his
marriage to Tsinirû of Ishoriöl did not fully win over the other Cûnuroi. It was only
after Sin’niroiha’s death of old age (as he had never endured the Inoculation), during
the Siege of the Second Delve, that the Blood of Tsonos was reunited in his son
Nil’giccas, who was able to unite the mansions once again under his leadership.</p>
<p>Finally, nigh on five centuries after the defeat at the Black Furnace Plain, the Inchoroi
were driven back into the Ark at the Battle of Isal’imial. No longer did the Cûnuroi call
it the Incû-Holoinas, the Ark-of-the-Skies. Now they called it Min-Uroikas , the Pit of
Obscenities, Golgotterath in the tongues of men. The Cûnuroi set about a methodical
eradication of the Ark, scouring it hall by hall. It took twenty years to explore and
secure every last hold and every last corner of the vessel but finally it was done. The
Inchoroi were pronounced eradicated, destroyed and defeated.</p>
<p>But a problem emerged, a secret so profound it was struck from the Isûphiryas itself.
During the exploration of the Ark a room had been discovered, the Golden Court of
Sil, from where the Inchoroi had prosecuted their war. In this room was located an
item or force known only as the “Inverse Fire”. Every Cûnuroi who had ever beheld
this artifact had been driven insane on the instant, proclaiming that the Inchoroi were
right and all the people of the World were doomed to damnation. It was this item
which had turned Nin’janjin to the enemy’s cause.</p>
<p>Nil’giccas ordered three of his greatest servants – the Ishroi warriors Misariccas and
Runidil, and the Qûya mage Cet’ingira – into the Golden Court to investigate further.
They returned, Misariccas and Runidil raving that the Inchoroi had indeed been
correct and that all the Cûnuroi were doomed to damnation and hellfire. Nil’giccas
asked for Cet’ingira’s opinion and he replied that his companions had been subverted
by the Inverse Fire and had gone over to the foe. He advised that Nil’giccas kill them
on the instant. He agreed. Cet’ingira, the lone Qûya who had beheld the Inverse Fire
and apparently resisted it, was spared.</p>
<p>Unable to actually destroy the vessel itself, Nil’giccas, King of Ishoriöl, ordered the
Qûya under Emilidis, the Artisan, to seal the vessel from the outside world. The
Artisan created his greatest achievement, the Barricades, it to hide it away from the rest
of the world and prevent entry. The Cûnuroi were forbidden from speaking of the
accursed place, or telling others where it lay.</p>
<p>The Cûnuroi had achieved their victory, but at catastrophic cost. Millions of their race
had been slaughtered. Every last Cûnuroi woman had been killed. There was no way to
restore their race, or save it. They were ageless, but not invulnerable. They could die in
battle. The very passage of time exacted a toll on their souls, their memories fading
until only the most horrific and scarring remained, and soon they began to descend
into madness.</p>
<p>Worse still, although this would not be known to the Nonmen for millennia, the
Cûnuroi victory was incomplete. Two Inchoroi yet lived: Aurang, the Warlord, and his
brother Aurax. Two where there had once teemed multitudes, surviving the Arkfall to
deliver war upon the populace of the World. But two could not hope to succeed where
tens of thousands had failed, not without allies. Looking beyond the eastern horizon,
they realised a weapon existed, a people who could become an army , who could do the
job for them, if they could manipulate and control them to fulfil their desire.</p>
<p>To this end, they went amongst those people, learned their sacred stories from them,
and created a fantastic artifact with those stories and scriptures inscribed upon it…with
one alteration. Included on this artifact of bone and wisdom was a command from the
Gods, to journey into the west and kill the “False Men” wherever they could be found.</p>
<p>The Age of the Cûnuroi waned even as, in the lands of Eänna beyond the great eastern
mountains, the Age of Man began.</p>
