# The Anatomy Of Negation

Edgar Saltus' "The Philosophy of Disenchantment" was an intriguing philosophical text. I bought it for free on Kindle from Amazon classics. One of his other works, "The Anatomy Of Negation", did not get the same treatment, and its lowest price on Amazon was about $10. There was no ebook version on the site. 

Still, [it was available on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/anatomyofnegatio00saltrich) as raw text and a scanned pdf - and other versions in theory. I decided to rectify that by using R's bookdown package to create multiple formats and release them for free. I went the long route by using OCR to get the text from the pdf. The covers comes from [here](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/10183?searchField=All&amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;what=Canvas%7cPaintings&amp;od=on&amp;ft=darkness&amp;offset=20&amp;rpp=20&amp;pos=21),
