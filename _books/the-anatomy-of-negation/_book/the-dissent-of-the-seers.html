<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 4</span> The Dissent Of The Seers</h1>
<p>In one of the forgotten plays of Laberius, a jester is represented as recommending a smug-faced companion to get a foretaste of philosophy in the latrinae. In one sense the jester was wise in his generation and clairvoyant too. About philosophy in general, and metaphysics in particular, the impolite have always discerned a bad odour. And this not without reason. In literature there is nothing more unpleasant than an attempt to prove something; indeed, if ever a proper penal code is devised, the dietary products of logic will be declared contraband, and every ergo banished the realm. In the absence of any criterion of truth, such a word as therefore has seemingly no <em>raison d’être</em>. The sum of all the angles of a triangle may be equal to two right-angles, but however amply that fact or any other be demonstrated, it cannot lift the inquisitive beyond the limits of an experience which in itself may be erroneous. Who shall say but that in some other sphere, where perhaps there are now such commodities as square fluids and moral substances, - who shall say but that there the sum of all the angles of a triangle may not be equal to two right-angles; or, as Mill has suggested, who shall say but that there is a land where two and two make five? Yet, waiving such magnificent hypotheses, and granting that deductions which follow from experience are not erroneous, it must be admitted that they bring us no nearer the truth; the essence, the reason of things is as intangible as before.</p>
<p>And metaphysics has yet another defect. The eternal questions. What am I? What can I know? - questions which it purports to answer - are left for all response as vague as the enveloping scholia. But the good that comes of evil is ever re-nascent, and out of the questions and answers have sprung the three foremost systems of modern anti-theistic thought. Of these. Pantheism takes the pre- cedence, which is the due of age. Its nominal founder is Spinoza.</p>
<p>The life of Baruch Spinoza should be taught to every schoolboy. It is not only as uninteresting as the ordinary studies of average youth, but it holds a lesson of such gentleness, modesty and abnegation of self, that in a search for a better one the whole parade of history might be reviewed in vain.</p>
<p>Like certain other notabilities, Spinoza was a Jew. His parents were descendants of Portuguese Israelites, who had fled from the Inquisition and unfolded their tents behind the dykes of the Netherlands. Today, in Amsterdam, any valet-de-place will designate the early home of the philosopher, and every valet-de-place will point to a different house. But when the sight-seer is tired into satisfaction, discrepancies are of small moment. Moreover, after exhausting his ima- gination on the Burgwal, any valet-de-place is competent to show the exact spot near the syna- gogue where a fanatic believer aimed a dagger at the thinker’s heart. The aim was unsuccess- ful, though it rent the coat; and this coat the guide, if he is clever, will tell you that Spinoza kept ever after by way of memorabilium. But, clever or not, give him a louis and let him go. Spinoza’s life is not such an one as should be listened to in the streets.</p>
<p>In the library at Wolfenbeütel there is a portrait of a grave, olive-skinned Hebrew, who stands in the upright idleness which is peculiar to portraits in oil. The hair falls back and over the shoulders in an expanding flood. The face is nearly oval, and the eyes are large and patient. This portrait, which is of Spinoza, was probably painted toward the close of his life. He died, it may be noted, at the age of forty-four, in the year 1677. As has been hinted, his life is without interest. If there was a tragedy in it, it was, as Mr. Wilde would say, that there was none at all. There is some mention of a little romance with the daughter of his teacher. But Spinoza was poor, and it is said that a wealthier student made diamonds of indifferent water fall in miniature cascades before the maiden’s unresisting eyes. It is possible that this legend, out of which Auerbach has weaved one of his charming tales, is not untrue. There is a quotation to the effect that Mammon can win his way where angels might despair; and if an angel, then, <em>à fortiori</em> a philosopher. In any event, Spinoza appears to have been jilted, which probably was the best thing that could have happened. A thinker should have everything, even to sex, in his brain.</p>
<p>Spinoza was educated to be a rabbi, but with increasing years he grew too big for Jewish theology and declined to visit the synagogue. It was then that some zealot tried to stab him. This argument being insufficient, the elders offered him an annual pension of a thousand florins, on condition that now and then he would appear in the synagogue and keep his opinions to himself Spinoza, was very poor, but his opinions were to him more precious than money. He refused therefore, and was excommunicated at once. The great ban, the Schammatha, was publicly pronounced upon him. For half-an- hour, to the blare of trumpets, he was cursed in the name which contains forty-two letters; in the name of Him who said, <em>I am that I am and who shall be</em>; in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the Tetragrammation; in the name of the Globes, the Wheels, Mysterious Beasts and Ministering Angels; in the name of the great Prince Michael; in the name of Metateron, whose name is like that of his master; in the name of Achthariel Jah. The Seraphim and Ofanim were called upon to give mouth to the malediction. Jehovah was supplicated never to forgive his sin, to let all the curses in the Book of the Law fall upon and blot him from under the heavens. Then, as the music swooned in a shudder of brass, the candles were reversed, and through the darkness the whole congregation chanted in unison. Amen!</p>
<p>After that, Spinoza, being no longer a Jew, changed his name from Baruch to Benedictus, and turned his thoughts from the Kabbala to Descartes. The life he thereafter led was one of extreme simplicity. He earned his bread by polishing lenses, and expended on it but a trifle more than the traditional obolus of Epicurus. When his father died, his sisters, arguing that a heretic had no right nor title to the property of the faithful, tried to keep from him his inheritance. Spinoza, however, appealed against them, won his suit, and then gave back as free gift all the contested property except one bed, which his biographer Colerus says, <em>était en verité fort bon</em>. A few other instances of his magnanimity might be given, and a few anecdotes of his gentleness related; but when they were told, the reader would find himself as unacquainted with the man as before. Properly speaking, he had no biography; his life was one of solitude; its essence was meditation; and the Wolfenbeütel portrait would have served its purpose better, had it represented the sombre face of one whose eyes were lost in thought, and whose patient hand poUshed a concave lens.</p>
<p>Spinoza’s fame rests principally on two works which shortly after his death were proscribed as profane, atheistic and blasphemous. These works are the <em>Tractatus Theologico-politicus</em> and the Ethica. The first is the key-note of rationalism, the second is the basis of modern philosophy. The rationalism of the first and the philosophy of the second stand in the closest connection. In both, Nature is shown to be an omnipotent ruler, in whose court such a parvenu as the supernatural is not received.</p>
<p>Spinoza’s negations are threefold. He denied the existence of an extra-mundane Deity; he denied that man is a free agent; and he denied the doctrine of final causes.</p>
<p>His negation of the existence of an extra-mundane Deity is not always clearly understood. The term <em>Deus</em> is strewn through his pages, and its repetition has often misled the unwary. There is, he taught, but one substance, and in this substance all things live, move and have their being. It is at once cause and effect; it is God. But the term thus used has nothing in common with the theistic idea of a Creator, who, having fashioned the world, “sits aloft and sees it go.” On the contrary, God and the universe were to Spinoza one and identical; they were correlatives; the existence of the one made that of the other a logical necessity. To him the primordial entity, the <em>fons et origo rerum</em> was God; but God was Nature, and Nature, Substance The three terms he used interchangeably; the former predominate in his earlier writings, the third in the Ethics. His reason for making use of the first is not entirely apparent, unless, it be, as Dr. Martineau has suggested, that even when the sun of Israel had set, he still loved to linger in the mystical penumbra of an earlier faith. But be this as it may, and however his use of the term may be interpreted, it is tolerably clear that Spinoza, far from, lowering the Deity to Nature, exalted Nature to a God. God was everywhere, and every region was filled with the Divine.</p>
<p>Spinoza has been frequently blamed for reading the banns over the unknowable and the known, and perhaps the blame is not altogether unde- served. But in this connection it may not be amiss to call Goethe to his rescue. And Goethe, it may be remembered, is the Spinoza of verse. “To discuss God apart from Nature,” said the poet, “is both difficult and dangerous. It is as though we separated the soul from the body. We know the soul only through the medium of the body, and God only through Nature. Hence the absurdity of accusing of absurdity those who philosophically unite the world with God.” Voltaire, however, took a different view, the view of an inconsequent historian who relies on his wit. Now wit is little else than the commonplace in fine clothes; and Voltaire, who treated the humdrum with the skill of a modiste, drew the threads of fancy, and worked an elaborate hemstitch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alors un petit Juif, au long nez, au teint blême, Pauvre, mais satisfait, pensif et retiré, Esprit subtil et creux, moins lu que célébré, Cache sous le manteau de Descartes son maître, Marchant à pas comptès, s’approcha du grand Etre: ‘Pardonnez moi,’ dit-il, ‘en lui parlant tout bas, Mais je crois entre nous, que vous n’existez pas.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That which is called Free-will had to Spinoza a purely verbal existence. To him, the state of mind at any given moment is the effect of some definite cause, which itself is the effect of a preceding cause, and so on without end. His argument is to the point: “Imagine that a stone which has been set in motion becomes conscious, and, so far as it is able, endeavours to persist in its motion. This stone, since it is conscious of and interested in its endeavour, will believe that it is free, and that it continues in motion for no other reason than that it so wills. Now such is the freedom of man, which every one boasts of possessing, and which consists but in this, that men are aware of their own desires, and ignorant of the causes by which those desires are determined.<a href="#fn8" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>This apt negation of free-will in man, Spinoza extended to broader spheres; and in showing that the force which moves the world acts because it exists and as it exists - that it has no alternatives, no standards of comparison of better or worse, and no appreciation of antitheses, of right or of wrong - in fact, in showing that everything occurs in virtue and in accordance with eternal laws which could not be otherwise - arrived at the consoling deduction that he who understands that everything which happens, happens necessarily, will find nothing worthy of hatred, mockery or contempt, but rather will endeavour, so far as human power permits, to do well, and, as the phrase goes, to be of good cheer.</p>
<p>There is something in the foregoing theory that seems to savour of Calvinistic predestination. But it is only a savour. To the Calvinist, predestination is made endurable by the belief that everything is ordained by the highest wisdom; while to the Pantheist, man is never the subject of fate. The laws of necessity are identical with his own nature, and it is through an understanding of them that he finds himself at peace with all the world.</p>
<p>Spinoza held the doctrine of Final Causes to be untenable, because inconsistent with the perfection that resides in God. His argument, which is advanced in the <em>Ethica</em>, has the charm which attaches to brevity: “If God acts for a designed end, it must be that He desireth something which He hath not.”</p>
<p>Spinoza was neither an optimist nor a pessimist. He neither laughed at life nor grieved over it. It is possible that he understood it. Like many another before him, he had looked about for happiness; and in the search he saw that such simulachres as wealth, distinction and pleasure, even to that <em>grande dame</em> whose name is Glory, were smitten with one and the same defect. The desire for them sprang from an archaic source, the love of the transitory. But happiness to be real, he argued, should be imperishable. And where could such happiness be found? - where, indeed, save in the love of the eternal and the unending, in the love of truth, which in purifying and exalting the heart shields it from vain desires? If Spinoza had not been a geometrician, he would have been a poet.</p>
<p>In the <em>Tractatus Theologico-politicus</em>, Spinoza noted, with great good sense, that a plain man who does not enter upon philosophy may without harm and even with profit believe whatever he finds most edifying, provided he believes it sincerely. And it is related that his hostess, a simple-minded Lutheran, having asked him whether the religion she professed was capable of assuring her salvation, he advised her to seek no other, nor to doubt of its efficiency. “Do but good works,” he said, “and endeavour so far as it is possible to lead a peaceful and virtuous life.”</p>
<p>As heine has well said, wherever a great mind gives utterance to its thoughts, there too is Golgotha. Spinoza was persecuted during his lifetime, and after death his works were condemned a profane, blasphemous, and atheistic. And yet it is probable that few men more sincerely religious than he have ever lived and taught. His doctrine was one of abnegation of self and patient devotion to the eternal. He was in love with the Infinite; it was Nature that fluttered his pulse; it was the Spirit of the universe that filled his heart with living springs. Nevertheless, there are today many warm-hearted and accomplished gentlemen whose views on Spinoza are a trifle more than two hundred years behind the age. To them he is still the blasphemer. But in all sincerity one may ask which is the more blasphemous, nay, which is the more vulgar, the mind that pictures the Deity as a jealous tyrant who keeps the world as a separate establishment, or the thinker who seeks to banish the dream that veils the part from the whole, and who shows the soul of man and of the universe to be the same?</p>
<p>In attempting to convey the higher view, Spinoza admittedly transcended the limits of experience. Indeed, there are contemporary free-thinkers who are ready to assert that he was sunk in the grossest superstitions. Perhaps he was; yet his superstitions were so refined, that in them there was room for nothing but the ideal.</p>
<p>A few years after Spinoza’s death, on the 22nd day of November, 1694, François Arouet and Marie-Marguerite Daumart, his wife, caused to be baptised at the church of St. André des Arcs in Paris, a male child, who, born dying six months before, lived long enough to christen himself Voltaire.</p>
<p>The heart of the eighteenth century was like a veilliebchen. As Michelet, who dissected it, announced, it was double. One half was Diderot, the other Voltaire; but Rousseau was wedged between. Voltaire wished superstition abolished and the throne preserved; Rousseau wanted the monarchy abolished and the altar upheld. Diderot sought the overthrow of both.</p>
<p>The united works of Diderot and Voltaire form a library of ninety volumes. But much of their labour is uncatalogued. Their ninety-first achievement is the French Revolution, their ninety-second is Modern Thought. If they are little read today, it is because their ideas have become common property, their daring seems less bold. Concerning Diderot, a word will be said later on; but no conjunction of phrases is rich enough to paint Voltaire. His figure is as familiar as the moon, yet the currents of his thought are almost as intangible. Nature, who, as Malebranche has said, speaks neither Latin nor Greek nor Hebrew, had taught him the nothingness of creeds. He had but one dogma, Reason. When he preached God and liberty, the liberty was freedom of thought, and God the deification of common-sense. In his vague deism there was room for many things. “Believe in God,” he said to a questioning rhymster; “believe in God; there is nothing more poetic.” But to Madame du Deffand, in whom he confided, he admitted his acquaintanceship with a man who thoroughly believed that when a bee died it ceased to hum. That man was none other than himself. In those days there were not a few who believed as he did. Among them was that most anti-christian of monarchs, the fat Frederick, who played badly on the flute, wrote verses that limp after him through history, but who possessed an enchanted sword, a nimble wit, and a great fund of appreciation for those whose views coincided with his own.</p>
<p>From this monarch there came to Voltaire an invitation requesting the pleasures of his society, and this invitation Voltaire accepted. Voltaire was never young. When he reached Berlin his hair was white, and he looked, Madame de Stael has said, like a wicked old monk come back from another world to visit this; but such a fascinating pagan was he, that in winning him from the fifteenth Louis of France, Frederick valued the gain more highly than a province.</p>
<p>At the historic suppers of the king, Voltaire likened the symposiasts to the seven sages of Greece in a lupanar. “In no corner of the globe,” he said, “has liberty of speech been greater, or have superstitions been treated with keener contempt.” Beside Voltaire and Frederick, the usual guests were the Marquis d’Argens, Lamettrie, Maupertuis, Algarotti, and d’Armand. The last-named gentlemen are relatively unim- portant, but the others should not pass unnoticed.</p>
<p>D’Argens was not only the king’s guest, he was his nearest friend, a sort of dignified Triboulet. He was a Provençal, an ex-freelance, hand- some and dissipated, who after a riotous career, during which he had explored most of the side scenes of life, made love in five languages, and fought over the better part of Europe, retired suddenly to Holland and burned the midnight oil. It was the old story of the devil turned hermit. In Holland in those days, thought was almost untrammelled. When a foreign author was afraid of the printers in his own country, he set those of the Netherlands at work, very much as the ultra-naturalists of contemporary France obtain today the assistance of Belgian publishers. D’Argens therefore went to the Hague, hired an apartment, shut himself up for six months, and then walked out with the <em>Lettres Juives</em> in his pockets.</p>
<p>The <em>Lettres Juives</em>, which are nothing if not liberal, were read and appreciated by the Crown Prince of Prussia, who at once asked d’Argens to pay him a visit. But d’Argens sent a regret. The throne was occupied by Frederick Wilhelm, and that monarch was not an agreeable person. If he took a walk, everybody took to their heels. Voltaire has given it to history that whenever he met a woman in the street, he sent her about her business Get thee hence, thou trull, thou trollope; thy place is at home!&quot; — a remonstrance which was accompanied as often as not by a blow or a kick; and Voltaire adds that whenever a minister of the gospel took it into his head to view a parade, he was, if caught, treated in precisely the same manner.</p>
<p>D’Argens knew him by reputation, and declined his son’s invitation with thanks. “To reach Potsdam,” he wrote to the prince, “I should have to pass three battalions; and as I am tall, well-built, and not altogether bad-looking, I don’t dare.” But when the prince became king, there was nothing to fear, and Potsdam counted another guest.</p>
<p>It was not long before d’Argens became the chamberlain, and, as has been hinted, the friend of the king. He was a brilliant conversationalist, epigrammatic, paradoxical, and possessed of great opulence of imagination. And Frederick, who at that time was possibly the only German in Berlin who knew how to talk, knew, too, how to appreciate that ability in another. The intimacy increased with years. When the king, overcome by public and private misfortunes, doubtful of the morrow and uncertain even of the day, reflected on the advantages which a bare bodkin can procure, d’Argens hurried to the rescue with comforting maxims. The King listened, but would have his say: “Philosophy, my dear Marquis, is an excellent remedy against the ills of the past or of the future, but it is powerless against those of the present.” “And what about the impassability that Zeno taught?” “Zeno,” answered the king, &quot; was the philosopher of the gods, and I am a man.&quot; Nevertheless, he took heart again, and all thoughts of the bodkin were dismissed. But d’Argens was not always so comforting. On the eve of the battle of Rosbach, Frederick happening to remark that if he lost it he would go and practise medicine in Venice, Triboulet steadied himself against a table and hissed, “Toujours assassin.”</p>
<p>D’Argens and Frederick grew old together. They had disputes which made them faster friends. They played practical jokes on one another, and quarrelled noisily over trifles. The king often acted like a school boy, and d’Argens not infrequently forgot that he was a philosopher. He remembered, however, that he was not born in Berlin. About Sans-Souci there circled at times an icy wind that made him dream of Provence. One day he asked for his passport. Frederick was vexed ; he did not like to be deserted it diminished him in his own esteem. “Bah!” he exclaimed, &quot; what is a prince born for, unless it be to cause ingratitude?&quot; But he gave the exeat, and d’Argens returned to his early home. Soon after he died - a convert, so it was said. When Frederick heard the rumour, he laughed he knew d’Argens too well to believe any such gossip as that. &quot; If he received the Last Sacrament,&quot; he said, “it is because it was given to him by main strength.”</p>
<p>“D’Argens,” said Voltaire, “has the wit of Bayle and the charm of Montaigne.” The doctrine which he displayed in the <em>Philosophie du bon sens</em> is a half-hearted Pyrrhonism. He, too, saw that there was no criterion of truth, but he could not always keep his eyes on the fact. “How,” he asked, “can men pretend to know the essence of things when they are ignorant of their own?” That they cannot may be readily admitted, unless it be that they are willing to supersede judgment with faith, which proceeding is the one that d’Argens recommended. He was deeply purposeful, but he was circumspect. What he shook with one hand, he steadied with the other. When he showed the advantages of belief, he was not in a greater hurry to do any- thing else than to show its disadvantages. First he honeycombed it with doubt and toppled it over completely. Then he set to work and built it up anew. After which he gave it another shake, and so on indefinitely, until his ink blushed and his pen refused its office. The method employed by M. Renan is not dissimilar.</p>
<p>There are few lands in Europe that have been more fecund in myths than Brittany. The belief in that lost city of Is, whose spires the fishers sometimes saw, whose bells, rung by the waves, clang through the winter nights, and whose magnificence was such that for the capital of France no better name could be found than Par-Is, equal to Is - the belief in that lost city was the origin of many beautiful legends. In few other lands has the faith in the weird and the supernatural been preserved with greater simplicity. Yet through one of those paradoxes of which Nature alone holds the secret, Brittany has been as fertile of doubt as of credulity. Many of the foremost of French anti-theists claim it as their home. Between Maupertuis and Renan there is a parade of familiar names, and of these names few are more significant than that of Lamettrie.</p>
<p>Lamettrie appears to have been an unprincipled saint, a rake without vices. He was brilliant and whimsical, an excellent purveyor of the entremets of the imagination; and as it is the individual and not the topic that makes or unmakes conversation, the great Frederick held him in high favour. Some years before Voltaire appeared in Berlin, Lamettrie had written a book, <em>l’Histoire naturelle de l’âme</em>, which had created such a stir that he had been obliged to leave France and seek refuge in Holland. There he published another book, <em>l’Homme machine</em> which created even a greater stir; and while he was wondering where he should hide, Frederick, who had read his writings, and who never let slip an opportunity of adding another philosopher to his collection, invited him to Berlin. “He is a victim of theologians and fools,” said the monarch; “let him come here and write what he pleases. I am always sorry for a philosopher in difficulties; were I not born a prince, I would be one myself.”</p>
<p>Lamettrie was quite willing to accord to a king the pleasures of his company, and took a seat at the royal supper-table without delay. Frederick was so charmed with him that he made him his salaried reader. “I am delighted with my acquisition,” he said; &quot; Lamettrie is as light-hearted and clever as any one can be. He is a sound physician and hates doctors; he is a materialist and not material. He says scandalous things now and then, but we weaken his Epicurean wine with the water of Pythagoras.&quot;</p>
<p>Like some other gentlemen of a sceptical turn, Lamettrie announced that vice and virtue were purely relative - a platitude which has been running about the book-shelves ever since books were shelved. But he added something which is worth larger attention: “Away with remorse!” he exclaimed “it is a weakness, an outcome of education.” And if virtue and vice are merely questions of surroundings, it is indeed difficult to view remorse otherwise than as a pre-mediaeval emotion. But virtue, to say nothing of vice, is something more. According to the Buddha, virtue is the agreement of the will and the conscience, a definition which would be matchless if the will were free. Marcus AureUus called it a living and enthusiastic sympathy with Nature but if the boundless immorality of Nature be conceded, as it should, the fine words of the emperor are as empty as the wind. Virtue, said one who had eyed it narrowly, virtue is a name. Perhaps. Yet virtue declines to be dismissed with a phrase; there is a disturbing magnificence about it which routs the most skilful. In de- scribing it, Raphael is a better lexicographer than Shakespeare, though even Raphael, for all his cunning, could not paint a temperament. And virtue is little else than a question of disposition. It may be sunned and watered by a thousand influences, it may be hedged and fortified, but in its essence it is temperamental. However great the outward success may appear, the lessons and precepts of ages will not suffice to keep it unspotted if the inner spirit be adverse. And as with virtue, so too with vice. Standards may differ with the dimate, but in each case it is the conscience that elects itself judge. It is the heart, memory aiding, that gives us a para- dise or a hell. If we could hush the conscience and still the heart, we might afford to listen to Lamettrie; and perhaps in future ages, when through the progress of evolution man will lose the lobes of his ears as he has already lost his tail, when he will be as completely bald as he was once entirely hirsute, perhaps then the con- science will go the way of useless possessions; but meanwhile to declaim against it is as profit- able as asking alms of statues. We are perfectly free to enjoy our remorse undisturbed.</p>
<p>Lamettrie admitted no other life than this, and not unnaturally- sought to make the most of the worst. His ideas are contained in a treatise on Happiness, which he prefixed to a translation of Seneca’s thoughts on the same subject. “Our organs,” he said, “are susceptible of sensations which render life agreeable. When the impression which a sensation conveys is brief, it is pleasure that we experience; prolonged, it is bliss; permanent, it is happiness. But in every case it is the same sensation, differing merely in intensity and duration. The absence of fear and desire is happiness in its privative state; but to possess all that one wishes - to have beauty, wit, talent, esteem, wealth, health and glory - that is a happiness which is real and perfect.”</p>
<p>The spectacle of a eudaemonist is as charming as that of a ballerine. Both belong to the category of the Delightful. But even though one be pleasured by a Taglioni, there comes a moment when the pleasure palls. Lamettrie, who was fond of adventurous flights and incursions - not perhaps to the unknowable, but to that which he might have known and did not - was wont to please his readers with the <em>entrechats</em> of a lawless imagination. As a consequence, his views, if entertaining, are valueless. The real and perfect happiness of which he speaks is a will-o’-the-wisp of fancy. The possession of all that one wishes, whether the possession is concomitant, as in fairy tales, with the wish, or obtained after years of striving, does not and never will constitute happiness. In its essence, happiness is intangible the desire for it is insatiable; and consequently, and despite every possession, it is ever unsatisfied. There may be a happiness which is transitory and fugitive, but there is none that is permanent. To say to the contrary is to announce one of the most insolent absurdities that has ever been proclaimed in the privileged aisles of the insane. For the sake of example, let it be supposed that in some one person are united all the factors which Lamettrie mentions - beauty, wit, talent, esteem, wealth, health and glory; if these possessions are what may be termed congenital, as in the case of a poet-prince, they are taken by their possessor as a matter of course, and have never served as preservatives from discontent; on the other hand, if their reunion is accomplished after more or less prolonged endeavours, their possessor, in obtaining them, finds himself as poor as before; he might be able to call the world his own, and yet not know what happiness is. The honours, the riches and glory to which he aspired, are as empty as the hands of the dead. If they are magnificent, it is only from afar. The best that can be, the best that ever has been, is in the discovery and maintenance of contentment. Its factors are two-fold - the first is health; the second, indifference.</p>
<p>Lamettrie’s chief titles to recognition rest on the <em>Histoire naturelle de l’âme</em> and the <em>Homme machine</em>. The first-mentioned work is an argu- ment against the belief in the immortality of the soul. With this doctrine ancient philosophy had little to do. With the exception of Pythagoras and Plato, the thinkers of classic antiquity agreed in one particular - the soul was material. Even to Tertullian its immateriality was unestablished. “Animam nihil est,” he said, “sed corpus non sit;” and not a few of the fathers of the Church held the same opinion. The masses of course thought differently. The belief in a future life was by them unquestioned. It probably arose from the re-appearance of the dead in the dreams of the living. But in Greece, as in the Roman Empire, the life prefigured was one in which there was little charm. The neglect of funeral rites turned it into a dull and restless torture. In this particular the observances of believers were little else than precautionary safeguards, and the <em>Requiescat in pace</em> which is to be seen on contemporary tombstones is but a forlorn survival of their naive superstitions. Later, when it was taught that the soul was imperishable, not through an inherent indestructibility, but through the influence of grace divine, its materiality was still undoubted. The soul and the body were considered inseparable. There were casuists who thought otherwise, and their disputes are legendary; but their disputes occurred in an era when faith was well-nigh universal. When the distinction between the soul and the body was at last satisfactorily established - that is, to those who were interested in the establishment of a satisfactory distinction - the believer found himself turning back to Plato. The soul was represented as a resultant of the forces of the body, very much as harmony is known to be won from the strings of the lyre. Yet, as Simmias queried, when the strings are broken and the wood reduced to dust, from what shall the harmony be produced?</p>
<p>In the <em>Histoire naturelle de l’âme</em>, little is said on this subject. It was not Lamettrie’s intention to narrate what had been thought; what he wished to do was to paint the soul’s development, and he put forth his best efforts to show that that which is termed soul is but the outcome of the perfectionment and education of the senses.</p>
<p>In <em>l’Homme machine</em> it is again a question of the soul, and the conclusion of course is the same. In spite of Descartes, who taught of two substances precisely as though he had seen and counted them; in spite of Leibnitz, who spiritualised matter instead of materialising the spirit; in spite of every one and everything to the contrary, Lamettrie, in broad paragraphs, proved to his own satisfaction that to think, to feel, to distinguish right from wrong as readily as blue from yellow, and to be but an animal, superior perhaps, but still a brute, is not a bit more contradictory than it is for a parrot or a monkey to be able to distinguish pleasure from pain.</p>
<p>“Man is a machine,” he said, “wound up and kept running by digestion. The soul is the mainspring. Both, of course, are material. As to thought, it is as much a property of matter as is electricity, motricity, impenetrability and breadth. To query with Locke whether matter can think, is tantamount to wondering whether it can tell time. In brief, man is a machine, and throughout the universe there is but one substance diversely modified. Such,” he concluded, “is my idea, or rather such is the truth. Dispute qui voudra.”</p>
<p>Another Breton who found a seat at the royal supper-table was Maupertuis. Before he found it, there had been some discussion among the erudite concerning the sphericity of the globe, and two separate expeditions were sent from France to measure different degrees of longi- tude. One went to Lapland, the other to Peru. Maupertuis, who was a geometrician, was placed at the head of the Polar expedition. He set out at once for Sweden, and after sixteen months of fatiguing adventures, returned to Paris to find himself the hero of the day. But in a city like Paris, a knowledge of the meridian, however exact, is not an attainment apt to make a man ceaselessly admired; and Maupertuis, who had taken the admiration quite seriously, and had had himself painted, mantled in fur, in the act of flattening the globe, soon found that his glory was so much vapour. Now Maupertuis was not only a geometrician, he was a philosopher, and the occupant of the Prussian throne was, as has been hinted, ever ready to add a new one to his collection; consequently, while Maupertuis was wondering at the inconstancy of his compatriots, a note was brought to him from Frederick. “Come to Berlin,” it ran. “You have taught the world the form of the earth; you shall learn from a king how much you are appreciated.”</p>
<p>The king at that time, however, happened to be in a battle-field; and to the battle-field Maupertuis, with the true spirit of a courtier, directed his steps. Unfortunately for him, Frederick was obliged to retreat, and Maupertuis was taken prisoner. At first it was thought that he had been killed; but when it was learned that he had been conducted to Vienna and there fêted at court, Voltaire took occasion to say a few smart things, and the world smiled with amusement and reHef.</p>
<p>At Vienna, the Queen asked him what his philosophy taught him to think of two princes who wrangled over patches of a planet which he had measured. “I have no right,” he answered sedately, “to be more philosophic than kings.” To change the subject, her Majesty deigned to inquire whether the Queen of Sweden was not the most beautiful princess in Europe. To which Maupertuis, who was nothing if not regence, answered, with his best bow, “I had always thought so until now.” After that, he was returned unransomed to Frederick.</p>
<p>At Berlin, a young Pomeranian lady fell in love with him. His conversation, it appears, was so lively, that women never suspected him of being a savant. The young Pomeranian became his bride; while he, through the king’s good offices, was made President of the Berlin Academy, - a sort of Minister of Literature, much as d’Argens was Minister of the Stage. Voltaire, meanwhile, was lounging at Sans-Souci. Maupertuis had not forgotten the smart things he had said, and Voltaire was perhaps a little jealous of the favour shown to a rival. But, be this as it may, it is a part of history that no love was lost between them. When Voltaire had the king’s ear, he poured into it scurrilous anecdotes about his compatriot; and when Maupertuis enjoyed a similar privilege, the tale of his grievances never tarried. “They take me for a sewer,” said Frederick, with the indulgent smile of a man who has said a good thing.</p>
<p>Frederick sided with Maupertuis. It is possible that in some kingly fashion he, too, was jealous, though in his case the jealousy was of one whose royalty threatened at times to overshadow his own. Voltaire was irascible he was annoyed at the preference and after brooding over his discontent, he composed and published a pamphlet entitled <em>Docteur Akakia</em>.</p>
<p>In this trifle Maupertuis was lampooned as no one had ever been before; his pet theories - to wit, that there is no other proof of God than an algebraic formula, and that nothing which we see is as we see it - were held up to the laughter of the world. Frederick caused the edition to be seized and burned by the headsman. Voltaire, however, was not easily circumvented. A few copies escaped the auto-da-fé and went careering over Europe. Maupertuis was for ever ridiculous, but Voltaire was still unsatisfied. He kept pricking him with his pen, until Maupertuis, outwearied with his struggle with an ogre, took to his bed and died of mortification - &quot; between two monks,&quot; said the relentless Arouet. “What do you think of him?” he asked d’Alembert; “he has been suffering for a long time from a repletion of pride, but I did not take him either for a hypocrite or an imbecile.”</p>
<p>Maupertuis was one of the first of the modern thinkers that have ventured to add up the balance-sheet of pleasure and pain, and also one of the first to discover that the latter largely exceeds the former; indeed, so large did the excess seem, that he had no hesitation in an- nouncing that were all that is painful in life suppressed and only the pleasurable moments counted, the duration of the happiest existence would not exceed a few hours.</p>
<p>He had scanned the <em>paysages de tristesse</em> as carefully as another, and the fairest vista that he saw was behind the delinquent hands of death. “Post mortem nihil est; ipsaque mors nihil,” - After death is nothing; death itself is naught, - said Seneca; and Maupertuis, who agreed with him thoroughly, advocated suicide, and praised the stoics for teaching that it was a permissible remedy, and one that was most useful, against the ills of life. “If,” he argued, “a man believes in a religion which offers eternal rewards to those that suffer, and which threatens with eternal punishment those that die to avoid suffering, it is not bravery on his part to commit suicide, nor is it cowardice, it is idiocy. On the other hand, a man who has no belief in a future life, and who is solely occupied in making this one as little unpleasant as possible, sees neither rhyme nor reason in submitting to misfortunes from which he can free himself in a trice.” Nevertheless, Maupertuis died a natural death, and, as Voltaire said, between two monks at that.</p>
<p>Maupertuis, Lamettrie, d’Argens, even to the philosopher king himself, were dominated and overshadowed by Voltaire. Though purposeful, their influence was slight; it had barely strength enough to cross the Rhine. But on the other side of that muddy river there was then a group of thinkers whose influence can be felt in some of the currents of contemporary thought, and concerning whom a word or two may now be said.</p>
<p>When the foremost of England’s sceptics, David Hume, visited Paris, he found a warm welcome at the house of the Baron d’Holbach. It was there, Burton says, that professing he had never met an atheist, Hume was told that he was in the company of seventeen. Of these, the more noteworthy were Diderot, d’Alembert, Naigeon and the host.</p>
<p>The Baron d’Holbach was a German who had been educated in France. He was a man of large wealth, wise, liberal, and charitable. His house in the Rue Royale, which was called the Cafe de l’Europe, was a free academy of the freest thinkers; and of free-thinkers, domiciled and transient, d’Holbach was known as the <em>maître d’hôtel</em>. But d’Holbach was something more; he was one of the field-marshals of the little army of materialists who were the forerunners of the Revolution, and a lord in the literature of anti-theism. His erudition is said to have been practically unbounded. There was nothing of value written or suggested with which he was unfamiliar. “No matter what system I may imagine,” said Diderot, “I am always sure that my friend d’Holbach can find me with facts and authorities to support it.”</p>
<p>The doctrine which d’Holbach advocated was as liberal as the sea. It was a doctrine of freedom in all things - in speech, in thought, in politics and in religion. Its tenets are displayed at length in the <em>Système de la Nature</em>, a work published in Holland, and, through a literary trickery then not infrequent, attributed to a gentleman who, being dead, could not be prosecuted.</p>
<p>“Lost at nightfall in a forest, I have,” said Diderot, “but a feeble light to guide me. A stranger happens along: ‘Blow out your candle,’ he says, and you will ‘see your way the better.’ That stranger is a theologian.”</p>
<p>This squib might have served as epigraph to the <em>Système de la Nature</em>.</p>
<p>“Man,” said d’Holbach, “is miserable, simply because he is ignorant. His mind is so infected with prejudices, that, one might think him for ever condemned to err. … It is error that has forged the chains with which tyrants and priests have manacled nations. .. It is error that has evoked the religious fears which shrivel up men with fright, or make them butcher each other for chimeras. The hatreds, persecutions, massacres, and tragedies of which, under pretext of the interests of Heaven, the earth has been the repeated theatre, are one and all the outcome of error.”</p>
<p>These bold words were the prelude to the frankest exposition of anti-theism that France had ever read. Its audacity terrified, but its austerity repelled. Its paragraphs were as Cimmerian to the chamber-maids and hair-dressers of Paris, as the gaieties of Lamettrie had been shocking to the pedantry of Berlin. Then, too, it was rich and elaborate in its materialism. To-day it seems a trifle antiquated; the world has thought more deeply since; but with its general outlines contemporary thinkers have had no fault to find. In these outlines Nature is represented as the one-in-all, beyond which is nothing. The main propositions tend to show that throughout the length and breadth of space there is merely force and matter, the infinite interconnection of cause and effect and that it is through an ignorance of natural laws that divinities have been imagined and made the objects of hope and fear.</p>
<p>On the subject of hope and fear, d’Holbach had much to say. The gist of it may be summarised in the fatalist axiom, Whatever will be, is. Everything that happens, happens necessarily, and in virtue of immutable laws. As to order or disorder, they are empty terms; like time and space, they belong to the categories of thought; there is nothing outside of us which corresponds to them. It is all very well for man to see order in that which is in conformity with his state of being, and disorder in that which is contrary to it; to call one the effect of an Intelligence acting toward a determined end, and the other the play of hazard. But order and disorder are but words used to designate certain states and conditions of being, which if permanent are called after the one, and if transitory after the other. Beside, Nature can have no aim, for there is nothing beyond it to which it can strive. As to hazard, it is meaningless, save in contradistinction to that Intelligence which man himself has conceived. Now man, d’Holbach explains, has always fancied himself the central fact in the universe. He has connected with himself everything that he has seen, and modelled everything after his own image. In this way he grew to believe that the universe is governed by an intelligence like unto his own yet, being at the same time convinced of his individual incapacity to cause the multiform eifects of which he stood a witness, he was forced to distinguish between himself and the invisible producer, and he thought to overcome the difficulty by attributing to that intelligence an aggrandisement of the prowess which he himself possessed.</p>
<p>The belief in the supernatural, which in man is inherent, d’Holbach regarded as a disease to which humanity’s greatest misfortunes are attributable. Truth, he was fond of saying, can never harm. Nor can it. But that does not make it a welcome guest. The whole history of religion goes to prove that man would rather be wrong in his beliefs than have none at all. Then, too, the majority have never been provided with such leisure as would enable them to dispense with illusions. The thinker may wave them away, but his gesture leaves the masses unaffected. Perhaps if the world were merely learned, it would be anti-theistic; but fortunately, or unfortunately, as the actual status of affairs may be viewed, it is something more or something less there is an unstillable longing, an unconquerable expectation of better things, which so exalts the heart, that the serenest of atheists can never witness its effects without experiencing some sudden pang of envy.</p>
<p>In the polite society in which d’Holbach moved, disbelief was so prevalent that it is possible he had no occasion to experience a twinge. And if he did, the emotion has been unrecorded. He was squarely opposed to the idea of God, and at the same time a living con- tradiction to the theory that an atheist is necessarily a man of lax principles. Wolmar, in the <em>Nouvelle Heloïse</em>, is the portrait which Rousseau took of him. Yet, as has been alrready intimated, it is the temperament, and not the point of view, that guides us into paths that are those of virtue or its opposite. And it was d’Holbach’s temperament that made him shame the Jew devil as Satan had never been shamed before. On this point the testimony of his contemporaries is unanimous. The purity of his life, and that, too, in a century when immorality was less a vice than a grace, has never been questioned. He was a simple-mannered gentleman, warm of heart, sweet tempered, endowed with great delicacy of sentiment, and possessed of such tact that even Rousseau, who would have quarrelled with an archangel, was unable to find in him any other cause of grievance than his wealth. “He is too rich for me,” he said; but he added, “He is a better man, and one more really charitable, than many a Christian. <em>He does good without the hope of reward.</em>”</p>
<p>The only immortality in which d’Holbach believed was fame. In life there is certainly nothing more exquisite. As Schopenhauer said, it is the Golden Fleece of the elect. But after death, and true glory comes but then, fame and ignominy are to the recipient equally unmeaning. And even were it otherwise, when it is remembered what are the limitations of fame, and when it is considered how small a value can be accorded to public opinion, the immortality in which d’Holbach believed does not seem worth an effort.</p>
<p>D’Holbach was one of the few writers that have had the courage to advocate suicide, and he advocated it as boldly to those who cowered at death, as he advocated virtue to a century whose vice is historic. His main argument in its favour is to the effect that the engagements between man and Nature are neither voluntary on the part of the one nor reciprocal on the part of the other. Man is therefore in nowise bound; and should he find himself unsupported, he can desert a position which has become unpleasant and irksome. As to the citizen, he can hold to his country and associates only by the mortgage on his well-being. If the lien is paid off, he is free. “Would a man be blamed,” he asks, “a man who, finding himself useless and without resources in his native place, should withdraw into solitude? Well, then, with what right can a man be blamed who kills himself from despair? And what is death but an isolation?”</p>
<p>Maxims such as these are considered dangerous and provocative. But maxims have never caused a suicide. A man may cut his throat or hang himself to put an end to the agonies of grief or boredom, but not because he has happened on a suggestive quotation. He will look for the great quietus if he wants to, but not because it is recommended. In any case the contempt of death is a useful possession; and it is well for every one to understand that while virtue and happiness are supposed to go hand-in-hand, and that to do good is to receive it, yet after the loss of any one of us the world will go on in quite the same manner as before.</p>
<p>In the days when d’Holbach was giving dinner parties in the Rue Royale, the flag of France was noticeably black. Some said that it was from the dye of the cassock; others, that it had caught the grime of mediaeval institutions. At d’Holbach’s dinner table, however, in the salons of Madame Geoffrin - she who was so plain that Greuze exclaimed, “My God, if she annoys me I’ll paint her!” - in the salons of Mesdames du Deffand, de Lespinasse and Necker, there assembled from time to time a handful of thinkers who were determined to give the flag of France another hue. These gentlemen were resolute and aggressive. The century, they saw, was hungry for ideas, and it was in an effort to give it food of the right quality that the Encyclopaedia was produced.</p>
<p>The Encyclopaedia - a name coined by Rabelais - displayed the genealogy of thought. was It at once a storehouse of knowledge, an attack on ignorance, an appeal to common sense, and a plea for liberty. It opposed every abuse, political, theological, ecclesiastical, industrial, fiscal, legal and penal. It sought to establish tolera-ion, to abolish sacerdotal thaumaturgy, to banish the supernatural, and thwart the subornation of the understanding. It was in no sense free from error, and its erudition presents today a most mildewed appearance; but it served its purpose, and from out its wide bindings burst the torrents of the Revolution.</p>
<p>In its opposition to everything that savoured of the illiberal, the Encyclopaedia encountered many an obstacle and not a few embarrassments indeed, the history of the government and literature of the third quarter of the last century is interwoven with that of its vicissitudes and final triumph. Every man of brains wrote for it, and those who had none and wanted some subscribed. The responsibility of its pubHliation was assumed by Diderot and d’Alembert.</p>
<p>Diderot was a giant, whose head was in the clouds and whose feet were in the mud. He wrote obscene stories and anticipated Lamark, Darwin’s precursor. History, art, science and philosophy he held in fee, and yet he was not erudite. He had drunk oft, not deep. “I know a great many things,” he said, &quot; but there is hardly a man that does not know some one thing better than I.&quot; In the activity of his mind may be found the reason of the admiration of his contemporaries and that of posterity’s neglect. He has left us twenty volumes of essays and digressions, but not a single book. Yet no one was ever so prodigal with his pen as he. He gave it to any one that asked, to an enemy as readily as to a friend. Grimm asked his opinion on an exhibition of paintings; he gave it in an in-octavo. “I have written a satire against you,” said a young man to him one day. “I am poor will you buy it?” “Ah! sir,” he exclaimed, &quot; what a pitiable vocation is yours! but,&quot; he continued, “I will tell you what to do. The Duke of Orleans honours me with his dislike; dedicate your book to him; he will pay you well.” A good dedication is a difficult job,&quot; said the young black-mailer. “Well, sit down,” Diderot answered, “and I will write it for you.” And he did, and the youth received his pay.</p>
<p>Diderot being without ambition was known as the Philosopher, but he was so poor that he could hardly buy the cloak. When he wished to dower his daughter, he found that he had nothing except his library, and his library to him was life itself. Nevertheless, he determined to sell it. Catharine of Russia learned of the determination and bought the library; but with a true sense of what is royal, she left him the use of his books and made him their salaried custodian beside.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his literary career, Diderot was a sincere deist, which, as some one has said, is a proof of what education may do. It was not long, however, before he saw that scepticism is the first step to philosophy; and when the step was taken, he descended without a compunction the precipitate stair of negation. The stages of his thought are well defined. “Aggrandise God,” he shouted in his first enthusiasm; “free Him from the captivity of temples and creeds. See Him everywhere, or say that He does not exist.” Later - in the “Letter on the Blind for the Use of those who See” - he manifested a classic indifference on the whole subject. “Ask an Indian how the world is suspended in the air, and he will tell you that it rests on the back of an elephant. ‘And the elephant?’ ‘0n a turtle.’ You pity the Indian, yet one might say to you as to him, ‘Admit your ignorance, and don’t bother me with a menagerie.’”</p>
<p>But his indifference was transient. “Among the difficulties (of believing in God), there is one,” he noted, “which has been agitated since the world began. It is that men suffer without having deserved to do so. To this there has never been an answer. The existence of a Supreme Being is incompatible with evils, moral and physical. What, then, is the safest course? The one which we have taken. Whatever the optimists may say, we answer that if the world could not exist without sentient beings, and sentient beings without pain, the Almighty would have done better to keep quiet.” Thereafter he became firmly anti-theistic. “It is,” he said, “highly important not to mistake hemlock for parsley, but it is entirely unnecessary to believe in God.” “The Christian religion,” he added, “is atrocious in its dogmas. It is unintelligible, metaphysical, intertwisted and obscure. It is mischievous to tranquillity, dangerous in its discipline, puerile and unsociable in its ethics, and in its ceremonial dreary, flat, Gothic and most gloomy. … If my ideas please no one,” he concluded, “it is possible that they are poor; but if they pleased everybody, I would consider them detestable.” Yet as he preached tolerance, he practised it, and was never known to refuse a crutch to those who had no legs.</p>
<p>Among the Encyclopaedists, where Diderot was king, d’Alembert was prime minister, a Mazarin, as one may say; but a Mazarin who grew faint-hearted, and, fearing the Bastille, left his monarch in the lurch.</p>
<p>D’Alembert was more a mathematician than a philosopher. His mistress was Algebra. History has given the same title to Mlle. de l’Espinasse; but if he was unfaithful, the lady in question appears to have paid him back in a better coin than his own. He was not a cheerful person, yet when alone with his books he was happy as though he were dead. &quot; Qui est-ce qui est heureux?&quot; some one asked him. “Quelque misérable,” he replied. He was an invalid, too but he hated medicine, and held a physician to be like a blind man who armed with a cudgel strikes at random, and, according as he strikes, annihilates the disease or - the patient.</p>
<p>As has been hinted, he was timid, or perhaps merely cautious, a trait which found little favour with Voltaire. “Philosophers are too lukewarm,” he said &quot; instead of shrugging their shoulders at the errors of mankind, they ought to wipe them out.&quot; But apparently d’Alembert did not agree with him. “Philosophers,” he retorted, “should be like children, who, when they have done anything wrong, put the blame on the cat.” But if for one reason or another he thought it best to keep his views from the public, he had no hesitation in whispering them to the sympathetic ear of Frederick the Great. The latter had written what he called a refutation of the naturalism conveyed in d’Holbach’s <em>Système de la Nature</em>. The book had annoyed him; but what probably annoyed him most was, not its naturalism, but its attack on the sacred caste of royalty. At the same time, as he himself said, if d’Holbach were condemned to be burned, he would be the first to play the hose on the stake.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the liberal monarch, d’Alembert, when answering the refutation, brandished the historic doubt. “Montaigne’s motto, What do I know? seems to me,” he wrote, “the answer that should be made to all questions in metaphysics. … Those who deny the existence of a Supreme Intelligence advance more than they can prove. In treating such a subject, scepticism is the only reasonable standpoint. No one, for instance, can deny that throughout the universe, and particularly in the formation of plants and animals, there are combinations which seem to reveal an Intelligence. That they prove it, as a watch proves a watch-maker, is incontestable. But sup- posing that one wishing to go further asks. What is this Intelligence? Did it create, or did it merely arrange matter? Is creation possible, or, if it be not, is matter eternal? And if matter is eternal and needed an Intelligence simply to arrange it is that Intelligence united to matter, or is it distinct? If it is united, matter, properly speaking, is God, and God is matter. If it is distinct, how can that which is material be fashioned by that which is not? Besides, if this Intelligence is infinitely wise and infinitely powerful, why is the world, which is its work, so filled with physical and moral imperfections? Why are not all men happy? Why are not all men just? Your Majesty assures me that this question is answered by the world’s eternity. And so perhaps it is, but seemingly merely in this sense, that the world being eternal, and in consequence necessary, everything which is, must be as it is; and at once we enter into a system of fatality and necessity which does not in the least accord with the idea of a God infinitely wise and infinitely powerful. Sire, when these questions arise, we should repeat ‘Que sais-je?’ an hundred times. Then, too, there is a consolation for ignorance in the thought that, as we know nothing, it is unnecessary for us to know more.”</p>
<p>To which Frederick, who gave a nickname as readily as a pension, answered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But, my dear Diagoras, if you fancy that I can give a detailed explanation of the Intelligence that I marry to Nature, you over-estimate my ability. I can say merely that I perceive it as I would an object of which I might happen to catch a glimpse through a mist.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>D’Alembert, however, was not to be played with, and he returned to the charge and routed the fat king with a fresh arsenal of queries.</p>
<p>“With the exception of the animal kingdom, the realms of matter with which we are acquainted appear deprived of sentiency, volition and thought. Is it possible that intelligence resides in them without our knowledge? Of this there is no evidence, and I am inclined to think that the block of marble, as well as the plants that are the most delicately and ingeniously organised, are without thought and feeling. But, it is objected, the organisation of these bodies discloses visible traces of an intelligence. This I do not deny; but I would be glad to know what has become of this intelligence since these bodies were organised. If it resided within them while they were being formed and in order to form them, and if, as it is supposed, this intelligence is not distinct from them, what has become of it since its work is done? Has the very perfection of the organisation been annihilated? To me, such a supposition seems untenable. If, then, the intelligence whose effects we admire in man is merely a resultant of organisation, why, in other realms of matter, may we not admit a structure and an arrangement as necessary and as natural as matter itself, and from which, without the intervention of any intelligence, would result the very effects which surround and surprise us? Lastly, in admitting the doctrine that an Intelligence presided over the formation of the world and still watches over its well-being, it is hard to reconcile the theory of that Intelligence with the idea of infinite wisdom and power. For, to the misfortune of humanity, this world of ours is very far from being the best one possible. With the best of intentions, we are therefore unable to recognise any other God than one who, at most, is material, limited and dependent. I do not know whether this view is the correct one, but certainly it is not that of the Deity’s partisans, who would much prefer to have us atheists than the Spinozists that we are. To mollify them, let us turn sceptic and repeat with Montaigne, Que sais-je?”</p>
<p>This amiable agnosticism was shared by few of the Encyclopaedists. To Naigeon, who would have nothing to do with half-way measures, it seemed little less than revolting. Naigeon was a Puritan without beliefs; his atheism was as fervent as his life was austere. When he first sat, a stripling, at d’Holbach’s table, he was largely ridiculed. He was a pretty boy, with fair skin and curled blonde hair. Diderot’s monkey. La Harpe called him, for it was through Diderot that he was brought into notice. But with age the comely lad developed into a tiger. To him Diderot left the care of his unpublished manuscripts, and these Naigeon edited, together with the memoirs of the author. He, too, was a voluminous writer, and scattered essays and treatises with a prodigality which he had caught from his master. But the work which caused the greatest number of people to turn about and look after him in the street was the <em>Theologie portative</em>. In it the beliefs and tenets of Christendom were treated, in a manner that reminds one of Col. Ingersoll. In the subsequent <em>Encyclopédie méthodique</em> he wrote again on these and adjacent subjects, though this time from a broader and more serious standpoint.</p>
<p>Politically, socially and morally untrammelled, he had, meanwhile, been keeping a finger on the public pulse, and he felt that some great, if undetermined, change was at hand. So soon, then, as the National Assembly got to work on its declaration of the rights of man, Naigeon issued an address, in which he prayed the Assembly to banish from the proclamation any suggestion of religion, and in its place to assert man’s right to entire freedom of thought and speech. But the petition was unnoticed. It is possible that he made a second appeal to Robespierre; but if he did, it was as unsuccessful as the first. And there is an anecdote that one day during the Terror he looked so much alarmed, that some asked him if he were on the list of the condemned. “Worse than that,” he cried. “That monster Robespierre has decreed the existence of a Supreme Being!” To Robespierre, an atheist was an aristocrat.</p>
<p>While Naigeon was addressing the Assembly, a young man named Sylvain Maréchal passed out of Saint-Lazare. A few months previous, he had pubhshed a little book entitled, <em>l’Almanack des honnêtes gens</em>, in which wise men were given precedence over saints. This disregard of etiquette procured for Maréchal an opportunity to meditate on the proprieties of life. When the prison doors were opened, he passed his time in succouring the indigent and housing the pursued. He fed and sheltered priests and royalists alike, and even paid masses for the repose of the soul of an old woman because he knew that such had been her wish.</p>
<p>Yet Maréchal was one of the fanatics of atheism, and as proud of negation as though he had invented it. The devil, one may see, is rarely as red as he appears on the stage. The thinkers with whom this chapter has had to deal were fervent in their disbelief; but in their disbelief there was room for such charity, tolerance and broad good will, that one looks in vain for a stone that shall hit them. Perhaps, as some one has said, it is only the just that have a right to be atheists. And yet they were not impeccable with one exception, they were guilty of a grievous sin against good manners - they were dogmatic. One may fancy that their voices were seldom modulated; it is probable that they shouted, and there are few among us that care to be shouted at. Then, too, there was a confidence and an assurance in their atheism which is as unpleasant as bigotry. They forgot Montaigne, and they let Pyrrho fall asleep. Maréchal was not better than the others; one may even say that he was worse, for he was dogmatic in rhyme; Since Lucretius, atheism had been without a poet. Leopardi’s father was then a bachelor, and Shelley was in the cradle. It was Maréchal that the irreverent Muse first ordered to. hold the lute. And Marechal kissed the Muse full upon the mouth, and sang loudly in a strain of boyish bravado. Whether or not Maréchal’s notes were listened to, is relatively a matter of small importance. A little later, the Being whose existence Robespierre had decreed was publicly deposed. The cathedral of Notre Dame was consecrated to the worship of Reason, the crosier and the ring were trampled under foot, and an ass, crowned with a mitre, was led through exulting crowds.</p>
